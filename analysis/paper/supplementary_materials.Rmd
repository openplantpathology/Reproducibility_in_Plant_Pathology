# Note 1: This chunk only needs to be run once on a computer to import fonts for
# use in R. This chunk makes .ttf fonts available to R for use and embedding in
# .eps figure outputs.
#
# Note 2: GhostScript needs to be installed at the system level for the PS files
# to be generated.  MacOS users can use `brew install ghostscript`.  Windows
# users should download and install. Linux users can use their package manager.
#
# Note 3: You may need to tell R where to find GhostScript's 'gs' executable.
# Set `R_GSCMD="/opt/homebrew/bin/gs"` in .Renviron for MacOS users using
# homebrew to install on a Mac M1.
# 
# Windows users can follow these directions:
# 1.	Go to the GhostScript website
#     <https://www.ghostscript.com/download/gsdnld.html>.
# 2.	Download the windows installer suitable for your machine
# 3.	Run the installer file which you downloaded and follow the prompts
# 4.	After running the installer click the windows "Start" button and type
#     "Edit environment variables for your account" and open
# 5.	In the tab 'Advanced' click the button at the bottom
#     'Environment Variables...'
# 6.	Under 'System variables' find the variable 'Path', select 'Path' and click
#     the 'Edit' button
# 7. 	Select a new line and copy the Ghostscript 'bin' folder location into the
#     field.
## 7.1	If you installed Ghostscript to the default folder location; then the
#     folder location will likely be "C:\Program Files\gs\gs9.52\bin", the
#     version number (9.52) may differ.
# 8.	Save and exit the environmental variables window
#
# This chunk is then run only if knitting on new computer that the files have
# not been generated

We fit a Bayesian logistic mixed model (estimated using MCMC sampling with 4 chains of 10000 iterations and a warmup of 5000) to predict comp_mthds_avail with year (formula: comp_mthds_avail ~ year). The model included abbreviation and assignee as random effects (formula: list(~1 | abbreviation, ~1 | assignee)). Priors over parameters were set as normal (mean = 0.00, SD = 1.00), normal (mean = 0.00, SD = 1.00), normal (mean = 0.00, SD = 1.00), normal (mean = 0.00, SD = 1.00), normal (mean = 0.00, SD = 1.00), normal (mean = 0.00, SD = 1.00), normal (mean = 0.00, SD = 1.00), normal (mean = 0.00, SD = 1.00), normal (mean = 0.00, SD = 1.00), normal (mean = 0.00, SD = 1.00), normal (mean = 0.00, SD = 1.00), normal (mean = 0.00, SD = 1.00), normal (mean = 0.00, SD = 1.00), normal (mean = 0.00, SD = 1.00), normal (mean = 0.00, SD = 1.00), normal (mean = 0.00, SD = 1.00), normal (mean = 0.00, SD = 1.00), student_t (location = 0.00, scale = 2.50) and student_t (location = 0.00, scale = 2.50) distributions."
