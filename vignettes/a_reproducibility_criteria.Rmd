## Key for data collection

This vignette documents the fields and values found in the "article_evaluations" sheet in the "article_notes" Google Sheets workbook, <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19gXobV4oPZeWZiQJAPNIrmqpfGQtpapXWcSxaXRw1-M/edit#gid=1699540381>

### Autogenerated values

In the reproducibility score there are two parts, one part is automatically generated, as much as possible, using the article DOI to retrieve the reference.

The articles' DOIs are looked up manually by Adam and assigned in the "[article_notes](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YrIiQ3OBNjCHMlalkMi1yy8dy4hnj5dnR4PSTj7lDR4/edit#gid=0)" sheet in the googlesheets document, `doi`.

Nik has provided the five-year impact factor, `IF_5year`.

Other items including `journal`, `year`, and `contains_page` are auto-generated by the ["Assigning Articles"](https://github.com/phytopathology/Reproducibility_in_Plant_Pathology/blob/master/vignettes/Assigning_Articles.Rmd) vignette.

#### "journal"

Auto-generated in "Assigning Articles"

Name of journal

Entered as character string in title case

#### "year"

Auto-generated in Assigning Articles

Year the article was published

Entered as a 4-digit number.

#### "contains_page"

Auto-generated in Assigning Articles

Randomly selected page number which is used to select article for evaluation.
The article is selected if it contains this page number in its page range.

#### "assignee"

Auto-generated in Assigning Articles

Randomly assigned evaluator selected from Adam, Emerson, Nik or Zach and assigned to a particular article (row)

### Manually entered metadata

### "doi"

Articles are looked up by Adam using the "article_notes" sheet in googlesheets.
The DOI is entered as a character string or left as `NA` if one is not provided.

Entered as a character string.

### "comments"

Comments column, Adam has used this to enter comments regarding article selection in cases where the `contains_page` number does not align with our criteria.
Can be used by evaluator for other comments on the article when evaluating.

Entered as a character string.

### "IF_5year"

Nik has looked up and provided the five-year impact factor for each journal and entered it in the "article_notes".

Entered as a decimal value.

### Evaluation of reproducibility

#### "open"

Whether the journal is open-access or not

Entered as `TRUE`/`FALSE`/`BOTH`

#### "repro_inst"

Does the journal have guidelines for reproducibility?

-   `0` - Not mentioned

-   `1` - At least a suggestion to put data online, but not details on how/where

-   `2` - Detailed instructions on where to place data

-   `3` - Detailed instructions on where to place data and code

#### "art_class"

What kind of research the article describes

One or more of the following:

-   `Fundamental`

-   `Applied`

Entered as an R `vector` object in comma-separated list with spaces.

For example: `Applied` or `Fundamental`

#### "molecular"

Was the article primarily focused on using or developing molecular methods?

Entered as `TRUE` or `FALSE`

#### "comp_mthds_avail"

Score of computational methods documentation

Are the computational methods used readily available, *e.g.*, R, SAS, Python scripts are shared?

Entered as a number between `0` and `3`

-   `0` - Not available and not mentioned in publication

-   `1` - Available upon request to author

-   `2` - Online, but inconvenient/non-permanent (*e.g.*, login necessary, pay wall, FTP server, personal lab website)

-   `3` - Freely available online to anonymous users for foreseeable future (*e.g.* archived using Zenodo, dataverse or university library or some other proper archiving system)

-   `NA` - No computational methods were used that can be shared, *i.e.*, there is no statistical analysis or figures that were prepared.
    For example, a molecular study used proprietary software for the experiment imaging and only gel images are included in the article.
    Then there are no computational methods to be shared.

In the case of multiple methods where some are available and some are not, score using the lowest value.

#### "software_avail"

Score of software availability

Entered as a number between `0` and `3`

-   `0` - Not available or not mentioned in the publication

-   `1` - Uses expensive proprietary software that institutions typically purchase (*i.e.*, ArcGIS standard is \$7000)

-   `2` - Uses proprietary software that most individuals can afford (*e.g.*, Excel, Matlab? (\$500)) or freely available non-OSS software

-   `3` - Uses entirely open source and free software (*e.g.*, R, Julia, Python)

-   `NA` - No software was used in the research that can be determined as the article is written.

#### "software_cite"

Score of citations for software used

Entered as a number between `0` and `3`

-   `0` - not mentioned

-   `1` - Software mentioned by name only

-   `2` - Software cited with version number

-   `3` - All software components (PROCs, packages) etc. cited

-   `NA` - No software was used in the research that can be determined as the article is written.

#### "data_avail"

Raw data availability score

Entered as a number between `0` and `3`

-   `0` - Not available or not mentioned in the publication

-   `1` - Available upon request to author

-   `2` - Online, but inconvenient or non-permanent (*e.g.* login needed, pay wall, FTP server, personal lab website that may disappear, or may have already disappeared)

-   `3` - Freely available online to anonymous users for foreseeable future (*e.g.* archived using Zenodo, dataverse or university library or some other proper archiving system)

#### "software_used"

Entered as an R `vector` object in comma-separated list with spaces, `NA` for no software that can be determined.

For example: `R, TableTool` or `R`

## Bibliography fields

The following fields are automatically filled by searching for the DOI and retrieving a BibTex entry, where applicable.
