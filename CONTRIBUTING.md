If you are not familiar with git and GitHub, take a look at <http://happygitwithr.com/> to get started.
* [Submit a post for your issue](https://github.com/openplantpathology/Reproducibility_in_Plant_Pathology/issues/), assuming one does not already exist.
  * Clearly describe your issue, including steps to reproduce when it is a bug, or some justification for a proposed improvement.
* [Fork](https://github.com/openplantpathology/Reproducibility_in_Plant_Pathology/#fork-destination-box) the repository on GitHub to make a copy of the repository on your account.
Or use this line in your shell terminal:

## Making changes

* Edit the files, save often, and make commits of logical units, where each commit indicates one concept.
* Follow our [style guide](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html).
* Make sure you write [good commit messages](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
* Make sure you have added the necessary tests for your code changes.
* Run _all_ the tests using `devtools::check()` to assure nothing else was accidentally broken.
* If you need help or unsure about anything, post an update to [your issue](https://github.com/openplantpathology/Reproducibility_in_Plant_Pathology/issues/).
