<p>Following the Sequential Effect eXistence and sIgnificance Testing
(SEXIT) framework, we report the median of the posterior distribution
and its 95% CI (Highest Density Interval), along the probability of
direction (pd), the probability of significance and the probability of
being large. The thresholds beyond which the effect is considered as
significant (i.e., non-negligible) and large are |0.05| and |0.30|.
Convergence and stability of the Bayesian sampling has been assessed
using R-hat, which should be below 1.01 (Vehtari et al., 2019), and
Effective Sample Size (ESS), which should be greater than 1000 (Burkner,
2017)._, _We fitted a Bayesian logistic mixed model (estimated using

<p>Following the Sequential Effect eXistence and sIgnificance Testing
(SEXIT) framework, we report the median of the posterior distribution
and its 95% CI (Highest Density Interval), along the probability of
direction (pd), the probability of significance and the probability of

significant (i.e., non-negligible) and large are |0.05| and |0.30|.
Convergence and stability of the Bayesian sampling has been assessed
using R-hat, which should be below 1.01 (Vehtari et al., 2019), and
Effective Sample Size (ESS), which should be greater than 1000 (Burkner,

<p>Following the Sequential Effect eXistence and sIgnificance Testing
(SEXIT) framework, we report the median of the posterior distribution
and its 95% CI (Highest Density Interval), along the probability of

<p>Following the Sequential Effect eXistence and sIgnificance Testing
(SEXIT) framework, we report the median of the posterior distribution
and its 95% CI (Highest Density Interval), along the probability of

<p>Following the Sequential Effect eXistence and sIgnificance Testing
(SEXIT) framework, we report the median of the posterior distribution

<p>Following the Sequential Effect eXistence and sIgnificance Testing
(SEXIT) framework, we report the median of the posterior distribution
and its 95% CI (Highest Density Interval), along the probability of
direction (pd), the probability of significance and the probability of
being large. The thresholds beyond which the effect is considered as
significant (i.e., non-negligible) and large are |0.05| and |0.30|.
Convergence and stability of the Bayesian sampling has been assessed
using R-hat, which should be below 1.01 (Vehtari et al., 2019), and
Effective Sample Size (ESS), which should be greater than 1000 (Burkner,
2017)._ and _We fitted a Bayesian logistic mixed model (estimated using
MCMC sampling with 4 chains of 10000 iterations and a warmup of 5000) to
predict comp_mthds_avail with abbreviation (formula: comp_mthds_avail ~
abbreviation). The model included assignee as random effect (formula: ~1
| assignee). Priors over parameters were set as student_t (location =
0.00, scale = 2.50) distributions. The modelâ€™s explanatory power is weak
(R2 = 0.03, 95% CI [4.62e-04, 0.09]) and the part related to the fixed
effects alone (marginal R2) is of 0.43 (95% CI [0.35, 0.48]). Within

<p>Following the Sequential Effect eXistence and sIgnificance Testing
(SEXIT) framework, we report the median of the posterior distribution
and its 95% CI (Highest Density Interval), along the probability of
direction (pd), the probability of significance and the probability of
being large. The thresholds beyond which the effect is considered as
significant (i.e., non-negligible) and large are |0.05| and |0.30|.
Convergence and stability of the Bayesian sampling has been assessed
using R-hat, which should be below 1.01 (Vehtari et al., 2019), and
Effective Sample Size (ESS), which should be greater than 1000 (Burkner,
2017)._, _We fitted a Bayesian logistic mixed model (estimated using

<p>Following the Sequential Effect eXistence and sIgnificance Testing
(SEXIT) framework, we report the median of the posterior distribution

significant (i.e., non-negligible) and large are |0.05| and |0.30|.
Convergence and stability of the Bayesian sampling has been assessed
using R-hat, which should be below 1.01 (Vehtari et al., 2019), and
Effective Sample Size (ESS), which should be greater than 1000 (Burkner,

<p>Following the Sequential Effect eXistence and sIgnificance Testing
(SEXIT) framework, we report the median of the posterior distribution
and its 95% CI (Highest Density Interval), along the probability of
direction (pd), the probability of significance and the probability of

significant (i.e., non-negligible) and large are |0.05| and |0.30|.
Convergence and stability of the Bayesian sampling has been assessed
using R-hat, which should be below 1.01 (Vehtari et al., 2019), and
Effective Sample Size (ESS), which should be greater than 1000 (Burkner,

<p>Following the Sequential Effect eXistence and sIgnificance Testing
(SEXIT) framework, we report the median of the posterior distribution
and its 95% CI (Highest Density Interval), along the probability of

significant (i.e., non-negligible) and large are |0.05| and |0.30|.
Convergence and stability of the Bayesian sampling has been assessed
using R-hat, which should be below 1.01 (Vehtari et al., 2019), and
Effective Sample Size (ESS), which should be greater than 1000 (Burkner,

MCMC sampling with 4 chains of 10000 iterations and a warmup of 5000) to

<p>Following the Sequential Effect eXistence and sIgnificance Testing
(SEXIT) framework, we report the median of the posterior distribution

<p>Following the Sequential Effect eXistence and sIgnificance Testing
(SEXIT) framework, we report the median of the posterior distribution
and its 95% CI (Highest Density Interval), along the probability of
direction (pd), the probability of significance and the probability of

significant (i.e., non-negligible) and large are |0.05| and |0.30|.
Convergence and stability of the Bayesian sampling has been assessed
using R-hat, which should be below 1.01 (Vehtari et al., 2019), and
Effective Sample Size (ESS), which should be greater than 1000 (Burkner,
2017)._, _We fitted a Bayesian logistic mixed model (estimated using
MCMC sampling with 4 chains of 10000 iterations and a warmup of 5000) to
predict data_avail with abbreviation (formula: data_avail ~

<li>The effect of b abbreviationVirolJ (Median = 0.87, 95% CI [-0.02,
1.73]) has a 97.17% probability of being positive (&gt; 0), 96.39% of
being significant (&gt; 0.05), and 89.52% of being large (&gt; 0.30).
The estimation successfully converged (Rhat = 1.001) and the indices are
reliable (ESS = 5691)</li>
</ul>
<p>Following the Sequential Effect eXistence and sIgnificance Testing
(SEXIT) framework, we report the median of the posterior distribution
and its 95% CI (Highest Density Interval), along the probability of
direction (pd), the probability of significance and the probability of
being large. The thresholds beyond which the effect is considered as
significant (i.e., non-negligible) and large are |0.05| and |0.30|.
Convergence and stability of the Bayesian sampling has been assessed
using R-hat, which should be below 1.01 (Vehtari et al., 2019), and
Effective Sample Size (ESS), which should be greater than 1000 (Burkner,
2017)._</p>
