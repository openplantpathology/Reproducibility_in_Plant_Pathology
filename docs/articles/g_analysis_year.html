<p>_We fitted a Bayesian logistic mixed model (estimated using MCMC
sampling with 4 chains of 10000 iterations and a warmup of 5000) to
predict comp_mthds_avail with year (formula: comp_mthds_avail ~ year).
The model included abbreviation as random effects (formula: list(~1 |
abbreviation, ~1 | assignee)). Priors over parameters were set as normal
(mean = 0.00, SD = 1.00) distributions. The modelâ€™s explanatory power is
weak (R2 = 0.06, 95% CI [8.82e-04, 0.23]) and the part related to the
fixed effects alone (marginal R2) is of 0.38 (95% CI [0.01, 0.48]).
Within this model:</p>
<ul>
<li>The effect of b Intercept[1] (Median = 398.59, 95% CI [-270.27,
1159.36]) has a 87.87% probability of being positive (&gt; 0), 87.87% of
being significant (&gt; 0.05), and 87.85% of being large (&gt; 0.30).
The estimation successfully converged (Rhat = 1.000) and the indices are
reliable (ESS = 22440)</li>
<li>The effect of b Intercept[2] (Median = 398.98, 95% CI [-269.84,
1159.68]) has a 87.89% probability of being positive (&gt; 0), 87.89% of
being significant (&gt; 0.05), and 87.87% of being large (&gt; 0.30).
The estimation successfully converged (Rhat = 1.000) and the indices are
reliable (ESS = 22438)</li>
<li>The effect of b year (Median = 0.20, 95% CI [-0.13, 0.57]) has a

being large. The thresholds beyond which the effect is considered as
significant (i.e., non-negligible) and large are |0.05| and |0.30|.
Convergence and stability of the Bayesian sampling has been assessed
using R-hat, which should be below 1.01 (Vehtari et al., 2019), and
Effective Sample Size (ESS), which should be greater than 1000 (Burkner,
