<p>_We fitted a Bayesian logistic mixed model (estimated using MCMC
sampling with 4 chains of 10000 iterations and a warmup of 5000) to
predict comp_mthds_avail with year (formula: comp_mthds_avail ~ year).
The model included abbreviation as random effects (formula: list(~1 |
abbreviation, ~1 | assignee)). Priors over parameters were set as normal
(mean = 0.00, SD = 1.00) distributions. The modelâ€™s explanatory power is
weak (R2 = 0.06, 95% CI [4.71e-04, 0.24]) and the part related to the
fixed effects alone (marginal R2) is of 0.38 (95% CI [0.01, 0.48]).
Within this model:</p>
<ul>
<li>The effect of b Intercept[1] (Median = 393.30, 95% CI [-259.06,
1135.27]) has a 88.33% probability of being positive (&gt; 0), 88.33% of
being significant (&gt; 0.05), and 88.28% of being large (&gt; 0.30).
The estimation successfully converged (Rhat = 1.000) and the indices are
reliable (ESS = 18761)</li>
<li>The effect of b Intercept[2] (Median = 393.71, 95% CI [-258.92,
1135.69]) has a 88.35% probability of being positive (&gt; 0), 88.35% of
being significant (&gt; 0.05), and 88.33% of being large (&gt; 0.30).
The estimation successfully converged (Rhat = 1.000) and the indices are
reliable (ESS = 18760)</li>

<p>Following the Sequential Effect eXistence and sIgnificance Testing
(SEXIT) framework, we report the median of the posterior distribution
and its 95% CI (Highest Density Interval), along the probability of
direction (pd), the probability of significance and the probability of
being large. The thresholds beyond which the effect is considered as
significant (i.e., non-negligible) and large are |0.05| and |0.30|.
Convergence and stability of the Bayesian sampling has been assessed
using R-hat, which should be below 1.01 (Vehtari et al., 2019), and
Effective Sample Size (ESS), which should be greater than 1000 (Burkner,
2017)._</p>
