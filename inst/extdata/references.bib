We measured virus RNA accumulation in TGR-1551 plants and a susceptible control (‘Tendral’) by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and also profiled the expression of 17,443 unigenes represented on a melon microarray over a 15-day time course. The virus accumulated to higher levels in cotyledons of the resistant variety up to 9 days postinoculation (dpi) but, thereafter, levels increased in the susceptible variety while those in the resistant variety declined. Microarray experiments looking at the early response to infection (1 and 3 dpi), as well as responses after 7 and 15 dpi, revealed more profound transcriptomic changes in resistant plants than susceptible ones. The gene expression profiles revealed deep and extensive transcriptome remodeling in TGR-1551 plants, often involving genes with pathogen response functions. Overall, our data suggested that resistance to WMV in TGR-1551 melon plants is associated with a defense response, which contrasts with the recessive nature of the resistance trait.},

  abstract = {Pathogenicity of the gram-negative bacterium Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria depends on a type III secretion (T3S) system, which translocates effector proteins into plant cells. Effector proteins contain N-terminal T3S and translocation signals and interact with the T3S chaperone HpaB, which presumably escorts effectors to the secretion apparatus. The molecular mechanisms underlying the recognition of effectors by the T3S system are not yet understood. In the present study, we analyzed T3S and translocation signals in the type III effectors XopE2 and XopJ from X. campestris pv. vesicatoria. Both effectors contain minimal translocation signals, which are only recognized in the absence of HpaB. Additional N-terminal signals promote translocation of XopE2 and XopJ in the wild-type strain. The results of translocation and interaction studies revealed that the interaction of XopE2 and XopJ with HpaB and a predicted cytoplasmic substrate docking site of the T3S system is not sufficient for translocation. In agreement with this finding, we show that the presence of an artificial HpaB-binding site does not promote translocation of the noneffector XopA in the wild-type strain. Our data, therefore, suggest that the T3S chaperone HpaB not only acts as an escort protein but also controls the recognition of translocation signals.},

  abstract = {A small heat-shock protein gene, CpHsp24, of Cryphonectria parasitica was selected based on its expression pattern, which showed that it was tannic acid inducible and that its induction was severely hampered by a hypovirus. The predicted protein sequence of CpHsp24 consisted of a hallmark α-crystalline domain flanked by a variable N-terminal and a short C-terminal region. Disruption of CpHsp24 resulted in a slow growth rate under standard growth conditions. The CpHsp24-null mutant showed enhanced sensitivity to heat shock, which was consistent with Northern and Western analyses displaying the heat-shock induction of the CpHsp24 gene and protein, respectively. Virulence tests on the excised bark revealed a severe decrease in the necrotic area of the CpHsp24-null mutant. When the hypovirus was transferred, virus-containing CpHsp24-null progeny displayed severely retarded growth patterns with hypovirulent characteristics of reduced pigmentation and sporulation. Because the tannic-acid-inducible and hypoviral-suppressible expression and the severely impaired virulence are also characteristics of the laccase3 gene (lac3), lac3 expression in the CpHsp24-null mutant was also examined. The resulting lac3 induction was severely affected in the CpHsp24-null mutant, suggesting that CpHsp24 is important for lac3 induction and that CpHsp24 may act as a molecular chaperone for the lac3 protein.},

  abstract = {Although 14-3-3 proteins have been reported to be involved in responses to biotic stresses in plants, their functions in rice blast, the most destructive disease in rice, are largely unknown. Only GF14e has been confirmed to negatively regulate leaf blast. We report that GF14b is highly expressed in seedlings and panicles during blast infection. Rice plants overexpressing GF14b show enhanced resistance to panicle blast but are susceptible to leaf blast. In contrast, GF14b-silenced plants show increased susceptibility to panicle blast but enhanced resistance to leaf blast. Yeast one-hybrid assays demonstrate that WRKY71 binds to the promoter of GF14b and modulates its expression. Overexpression of GF14b induces expression of jasmonic acid (JA) synthesis-related genes but suppresses expression of salicylic acid (SA) synthesis-related genes. In contrast, suppressed GF14b expression causes decreased expression of JA synthesis-related genes but activation of SA synthesis-related genes. These results suggest that GF14b positively regulates panicle blast resistance but negatively regulates leaf blast resistance, and that GF14b-mediated disease resistance is associated with the JA- and SA-dependent pathway. The different functions for 14-3-3 proteins in leaf and panicle blast provide new evidence that leaf and panicle blast resistance are controlled by different mechanisms.},

The microbiological process of detoxification and transformation of toxic organic pollutants is a promising method for foodstuffs decontamination. Some basidiomycetes, such as the {\textless}em{\textgreater}Pleurotus eryngii{\textless}/em{\textgreater} species complex, include several important commercial edible varieties that can detoxify polycyclic organic compounds and a range of wastes and pollutants. We investigated the potential role of {\textless}em{\textgreater}P. eryngii{\textless}/em{\textgreater}, one of the most consumed mushrooms, in the decontamination of FB$_{\textrm{1}}$ in maize. In addition, selected antioxidant enzymes, (soluble peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT) and ascorbate peroxidase), primarily involved in control of cell hydrogen peroxide levels, and lignin degradation, were analyzed, to evaluate their contributions to the molecular mechanisms of FB$_{\textrm{1}}$ by {\textless}em{\textgreater}P. eryngii{\textless}/em{\textgreater}. FB$_{\textrm{1}}$ decontamination by {\textless}em{\textgreater}P. eryngii{\textless}/em{\textgreater} and involvement of CAT and POD enzymes in the control of toxic decontamination levels of H$_{\textrm{2}}$O$_{\textrm{2}}$ were demonstrated. A consistent reduction of FB$_{\textrm{1}}$ was observed at different incubation times. The average decrease levels of FB$_{\textrm{1}}$, with respect to the control cultures, ranged from 45 to 61\% (RSD \&lt; 15\%). This study is a possible eco-friendly approach to reducing this mycotoxin in the feed supply chains.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

  abstract = {Mycotoxin contamination of maize ({\textless}em{\textgreater}Zea mays{\textless}/em{\textgreater} L.) grain is a global threat to the safety of both human food and animal feed. Hence, the development of maize genotypes with reduced mycotoxin accumulation in grain is of major importance. In order to find maize germplasm sources of resistance to Fusarium ear rot, 34 Italian and six public inbred lines were evaluated by means of artificial inoculation in field experiments during 2009 and 2010. Relationships between ear rot and fumonisin concentration in the ears were investigated. Primary ears were challenged with a mixture of two {\textless}em{\textgreater}Fusarium verticillioides{\textless}/em{\textgreater} isolates from Northern Italy, through kernel inoculation, and ear rot severity was assessed.The average number of visibly infected kernels per ear, after inoculation, ranged from 2 to 68 in 2009 and from 0 to 120 in 2010. Fumonisin concentrations in the inoculated ears were greater than in the experimental controls for both years. Variability was found between the inbred lines: fumonisin accumulation ranged from 0.56 to 240.83 mg kg-1 in 2009 and from 1.09 to 190.60 mg kg-1 in 2010. In both years, six inbred lines showed high fumonisin content (≥100 mg kg-1), while the other genotypes were almost equally split into two groups, low (≤10 mg kg-1) and medium (from 11 to 100 mg kg-1) fumonisin content. The number of infected kernels after artificial inoculation correlated with fumonisin concentration both in 2009 (r = 0.94; P≤0.01) and 2010 (r = 0.67; P≤0.01). Additionally, the percentage of internally infected kernels correlated positively with fumonisin concentration (r = 0.37; P≤0.01) and with the number of infected kernels (r = 0.29; P≤0.05). This research has demonstrated that Italian maize germplasm is a valid source of resistance to Fusarium ear rot. Furthermore, there is a strong association of visible {\textless}em{\textgreater}Fusarium{\textless}/em{\textgreater} symptoms with fumonisin concentration, suggesting that selection in maize for reduced visible moulds should reduce the risk of mycotoxin contamination.},

  abstract   = {In spite of multiple studies elucidating individual defense mechanisms against stalk borer feeding, little information is available about the plant response to these members of Lepidoptera. Four maize inbred lines were cultivated in a greenhouse and challenged with larvae of the corn borer Sesamia nonagrioides. Transcriptome and biochemical analyses were performed to elucidate the maize response mechanisms to this insect. General plant defense mechanisms were activated, including the jasmonic acid biosynthetic pathway, proteinase inhibitors, and four defense-related transcription factors. Interestingly, gene ontology analysis shows that maize plants undergo cell-wall reorganization after being attacked. These results were confirmed through biochemical analyses showing that the concentration of some cell-wall-related compounds significantly changed after plant infestation in a genotype-dependent way. In conclusion, maize plants respond to the attack of the corn borer S. nonagrioides through cell-wall fortification, activating genes involved in cell-wall organization, which finally is reflected in a higher concentration of some cell-wall components, especially in resistant genotypes.},

  abstract = {Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been shown to have a crucial role in plant defense responses and signaling pathways. In addition, ROS also have direct toxicity against pathogens. However, the molecular mechanisms of plant ROS in the direct effects against pathogens is still unclear. To investigate the function of plant ROS in the interactions of plant and bacterial pathogens, we focused on oxyR, encoding an oxidative stress-regulated transcription factor in Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (DC3000), and generated an ΔoxyR mutant. The DC3000 ΔoxyR mutant showed high sensitivity to oxidative stress in comparison with wild type and the complemented line. The host plants of DC3000, including tomato and Arabidopsis inoculated with the ΔoxyR mutant, clearly showed reduced disease symptoms as well as reduced bacterial populations. Expression profiles of DC3000 genes revealed that OxyR could regulate the expression of genes encoding ROS-detoxifying enzymes, including catalases (KatB and KatG), in response to ROS. We also demonstrated that the expression of katB could be regulated by OxyR during the infection of DC3000 in Arabidopsis. These results suggest that OxyR has an important role in the virulence of DC3000 by regulating the expression of genes related to oxidative stress.},

We developed a maximum entropy model for {\textless}em{\textgreater}X. fastidiosa {\textless}/em{\textgreater}in Italy. Our objectives were to carry out a preliminary analysis of the species’ potential geographical distribution and determine which eco-geographical variables may favour its presence in other Italian regions besides Apulia. The analysis of single variable contribution showed that precipitation of the driest (40.3\%) and wettest (30.4\%) months were the main factors influencing model performance. Altitude, precipitation of warmest quarter, mean temperature of coldest quarter, and land cover provided a total contribution of 19.5\%. Based on the model predictions, {\textless}em{\textgreater}X. fastidiosa{\textless}/em{\textgreater} has a high probability (\&gt; 0.8) of colonizing areas characterized by: i) low altitude (0–150 m a.s.l.); ii) precipitations in the driest month \&lt; 10 mm, in the wettest month ranging between 80–110 mm and during the warmest quarter \&lt; 60 mm; iii) mean temperature of coldest quarter ≥ 8°C; iv) agricultural areas comprising intensive agriculture, complex cultivation patterns, olive groves, annual crops associated with permanent crops, orchards and vineyards; forest (essentially oak woodland); and Mediterranean shrubland. Species distribution models showed a high probability of {\textless}em{\textgreater}X. fastidiosa{\textless}/em{\textgreater} occurrence in the regions of Apulia, Calabria, Basilicata, Sicily, Sardinia and coastal areas of Campania, Lazio and south Tuscany. Maxent models achieved excellent levels of predictive performance according to area under curve (AUC), true skill statistic (TSS) and minimum difference between training and testing AUC data (AUC$_{\textrm{diff}}$).

Growth chamber experiments using Petri dishes revealed that rhizobia infection on chickpea roots reduced broomrape seed germination, and restricted the broomrape attachment to host roots while retarding tubercle formation and development by the parasite. In pot experiments, chickpea roots inoculated with rhizobia reduced the total number of broomrape by up to 90\%. Broomrape necrosis was observed both before and after parasite attachment to inoculated chickpea roots in Petri dishes and pot experiments. Reduction in infection was accompanied by enhanced levels of the defence-related enzymes phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) and peroxidase (POX). Increased levels of phenolics were recorded in the roots of rhizobia-inoculated plants grown in the presence of broomrape.

The two proteins share methyltransferase and helicase domains and form a heterodimer implicated in gRNA replication. The shorter protein is also implicated in suppressing RNA silencing–based antiviral defenses. Using a stop codon mutant of Oilseed rape mosaic tobamovirus (ORMV), we demonstrate that the readthrough replicase (p182) is sufficient for gRNA replication and for subgenomic RNA transcription during systemic infection in Nicotiana benthamiana and Arabidopsis thaliana. However, the mutant virus displays milder symptoms and does not interfere with HEN1-mediated methylation of viral short interfering (si)RNAs or plant small (s)RNAs. The mutant virus tends to revert the stop codon, thereby restoring expression of the shorter protein (p125), even in the absence of plant Dicer-like activities that generate viral siRNAs. Plant RDR activities that generate endogenous siRNA precursors do not prevent replication or movement of the mutant virus, and double-stranded precursors of viral siRNAs representing the entire virus genome are likely synthesized by p182. Transgenic expression of p125 partially recapitulates the ORMV disease symptoms associated with overaccumulation of plant sRNAs. Taken together, the readthrough replicase p182 is sufficient for viral replication and transcription but not for silencing suppression. By contrast, the shorter p125 protein suppresses silencing, provokes severe disease symptoms, causes overaccumulation of unmethylated viral and plant sRNAs but it is not an essential component of the viral replicase complex.},

              −1
              greatly affected nematode movement and also caused mortality. The analysis of sequential extracts at the same experimental concentrations showed that, although water extracts affect nematode mobility and mortality, the acetone extract from
              S. nigrum
              was the most efficient, causing 100\% mortality after 23 h exposure. The results showed that

  abstract = {The effect of exogenous applications of potassium (K), calcium (Ca), and nitrogen (N) on the susceptibility of four banana cultivars to Banana Xanthomonas wilt (BXW) was studied. Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium with normal concentrations of K at 783 mg/liter, Ca at 121 mg/liter, and N at 841 mg/liter was modified to contain various concentrations of K, Ca, and N. Each nutrient was varied singly, each with three replicate experiments. The concentrations were K at 78, 157, 391, 783, 1,565, and 3,913 mg/liter; Ca at 12, 24, 60, 121, 241, and 603 mg/liter; and N at 84, 168, 420, 841, and 1,682 mg/liter. Plantlets were generated in vitro on normal MS medium and later exposed to the nutrient concentrations for a total of 8 weeks. Thereafter, they were artificially inoculated with Xanthomonas campestris pv. musacearum using an insulin syringe. In each nutrient, plantlets exposed to higher nutrient concentrations significantly (P {\textless} 0.0001) accumulated more nutrient in their tissues compared with those exposed to lesser nutrient concentrations. Wilt incidences were significantly reduced, and incubation periods (time from inoculation to appearance of first disease symptoms) increased, with increasing nutrient application. The study lays a background for in vivo studies aimed at management of BXW using nutrients, such as fertilizer application.},

  abstract = {Aspergillus flavus is the major producer of carcinogenic aflatoxins worldwide in crops. Populations of A. flavus are characterized by high genetic variation and the source of this variation is likely sexual reproduction. The fungus is heterothallic and laboratory crosses produce ascospore-bearing ascocarps embedded within sclerotia. However, the capacity for sexual reproduction in sclerotia naturally formed in crops has not been examined. Corn was grown for 3 years under different levels of drought stress at Shellman, GA, and sclerotia were recovered from 146 ears (0.6\% of ears). Sclerotia of A. flavus L strain were dominant in 2010 and 2011 and sclerotia of A. flavus S strain were dominant in 2012. The incidence of S strain sclerotia in corn ears increased with decreasing water availability. Ascocarps were not detected in sclerotia at harvest but incubation of sclerotia on the surface of nonsterile soil in the laboratory resulted in the formation of viable ascospores in A. flavus L and S strains and in homothallic A. alliaceus. Ascospores were produced by section Flavi species in 6.1\% of the 6,022 sclerotia (18 of 84 ears) in 2010, 0.1\% of the 2,846 sclerotia (3 of 36 ears) in 2011, and 0.5\% of the 3,106 sclerotia (5 of 26 ears) in 2012. For sexual reproduction to occur under field conditions, sclerotia may require an additional incubation period on soil following dispersal at crop harvest.},

In this study, we demonstrate that two nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) genes (F-avi3342 and F-avi5730) and one polyketide synthase gene (F-avi4330) are required for GTI. Knockout of any one of them resulted in F/25 losing GTI capacity. We previously reported that F-avi3342 and F-avi4330 but not F-avi5730 are required for induction of grape tissue necrosis and tobacco hypersensitive response. F-avi5730 is predicted to encode a single modular NRPS. It is located in a cluster that is homologous to the siderophore vicibactin biosynthesis locus in Rhizobium species. Individual disruption of F-avi5730 and two immediate downstream genes, F-avi5731 and F-avi5732, all resulted in reduced siderophore production; however, only F-avi5730 was found to be required for GTI. Complemented F-avi5730 mutant (ΔF-avi5730
              +
              ) restored a wild-type level of GTI activity. It was determined that, over time, populations of ΔF-avi4330, ΔF-avi3342, and ΔF-avi5730 at inoculated wound sites on grapevine did not differ from those of ΔF-avi5730
              +
              indicating that loss of GTI was not due to reduced colonization of wound sites by mutants.},

  abstract = {Esophageal glands of plant-parasitic nematodes are highly specialized cells whose gene expression products include secreted effector proteins, which govern nematode parasitism of host plants. Therefore, elucidating the transcriptomes of esophageal glands with the goal of identifying nematode effectors is a promising avenue to understanding nematode parasitism and its evolutionary origins as well as to devising nematode control strategies. We have developed a method to separate and isolate individual esophageal gland cells from multiple species of plant-parasitic nematodes while preserving RNA quality. We have used such isolated gland cells for transcriptome analysis via high-throughput DNA sequencing. This method relies on the differential histochemical staining of the gland cells after homogenization of phytonematode tissues. Total RNA was extracted from whole gland cells isolated from eight different plant-parasitic nematode species. To validate this approach, the isolated RNA from three plant-parasitic nematode species—Globodera rostochiensis, Pratylenchus penetrans, and Radopholus similis—was amplified, gel purified, and used for 454 sequencing. We obtained 456,801 total reads with an average read length of 409 bp. Sequence analyses revealed the presence of homologs of previously known nematode effectors in these libraries, thus validating our approach. These data provide compelling evidence that this technical advance can be used to relatively easily and expediently discover effector repertoires of plant-parasitic nematodes.},

Spore abundance was assessed at different distances and heights from inoculum sources and microclimatic factors were recorded during two consecutive years. Conidia were observed on spore traps from June to September during periods of rainfall. It was rare to detect spores more than 2 m away from inoculum sources. The timing and number of conidia dispersed were strongly tied to the climatic variables, particularly rainfall and leaf wetness. Should the trend toward increased spring and summer precipitation in the study area continue, the results suggest that disease spread and intensification will also increase. Increasing the planting distances between lodgepole pine trees through mixed species plantations and overall reduction in use of lodgepole pine for regeneration in wet areas are the best strategies to reduce the spread of the disease and enhance future productivity of plantations in the study area.},

In the current study, we attempted to confirm powdery mildew resistance phenotypes through vineyard, greenhouse, and in vitro inoculations for test cross-mapping populations for two resistance sources: (i) a complex hybrid breeding line, ‘Bloodworth 81-107-11', of at least Vitis rotundifolia, V. vinifera, V. berlandieri, V. rupestris, V. labrusca, and V. aestivalis background; and (ii) Vitis hybrid ‘Tamiami’ of V. aestivalis and V. vinifera origin. Statistical analysis of vineyard resistance data suggested the segregation of two and three race-specific resistance genes from the two sources, respectively. However, in each population, some resistant progeny were susceptible in greenhouse or in vitro screens, which suggested the presence of Erysiphe necator isolates virulent on progeny segregating for one or more resistance genes. Controlled inoculation of resistant and susceptible progeny with a diverse set of E. necator isolates clearly demonstrated the presence of fungal races differentially interacting with race-specific resistance genes, providing proof of race specificity in the grape powdery mildew pathosystem. Consistent with known race-specific resistance mechanisms, both resistance sources were characterized by programmed cell death of host epidermal cells under appressoria, which arrested or slowed hyphal growth; this response was also accompanied by collapse of conidia, germ tubes, appressoria, and secondary hyphae. The observation of prevalent isolates virulent on progeny with multiple race-specific resistance genes before resistance gene deployment has implications for grape breeding strategies. We suggest that grape breeders should characterize the mechanisms of resistance and pyramid multiple resistance genes with different mechanisms for improved durability.},

  abstract = {Puccinia horiana Henn., a quarantine-significant fungal pathogen and causal agent of chrysanthemum white rust (CWR), was first discovered in the United States in 1977 and later believed to have been eradicated. Recently, however, the disease has sporadically reappeared in the northeastern US. Possible explanations for the reappearance include survival of the pathogen in the local environment, and reintroduction from other locations. To determine the possibility that the pathogen might be overwintering in the field, we undertook the study described here. Results from the study showed that P. horiana teliospores, imbedded in infected leaves, were capable of sporulating 2 weeks after inoculation, and this capacity continued until the leaf became necrotic and desiccated. This is the first report of the extreme susceptibility of P. horiana teliospores to leaf necrosis and desiccation and suggests that field infections following winter are unlikely to originate from teliospores. Teliospore germination on excised leaves was shown to be inhibited by light.

  abstract   = {Soil suppressiveness to Fusarium disease was induced by incubating sandy soil with debris of wild rocket (WR; Diplotaxis tenuifolia) under field conditions. We studied microbial dynamics in the roots of cucumber seedlings following transplantation into WR-amended or nonamended soil, as influenced by inoculation with Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. radicis-cucumerinum. Disease symptoms initiated in nonamended soil 6 days after inoculation, compared with 14 days in WR-amended soil. Root infection by F. oxysporum f. sp. radicis-cucumerinum was quantified using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Target numbers were similar 3 days after inoculation for both WR-amended and nonamended soils, and were significantly lower (66\%) 6 days after inoculation and transplanting into the suppressive (WR-amended) soil. This decrease in root colonization was correlated with a reduction in disease (60\%) 21 days after inoculation and transplanting into the suppressive soil. Fungal community composition on cucumber roots was assessed using mass sequencing of fungal internal transcribed spacer gene fragments. Sequences related to F. oxysporum, Fusarium sp. 14005, Chaetomium sp. 15003, and an unclassified Ascomycota composed 96\% of the total fungal sequences in all samples. The relative abundances of these major groups were highly affected by root inoculation with F. oxysporum f. sp. radicis-cucumerinum, with a 10-fold increase in F. oxysporum sequences, but were not affected by the WR amendment. Quantitative analysis and mass-sequencing methods indicated a qualitative shift in the root's bacterial community composition in suppressive soil, rather than a change in bacterial numbers. A sharp reduction in the size and root dominance of the Massilia population in suppressive soil was accompanied by a significant increase in the relative abundance of specific populations; namely, Rhizobium, Bacillus, Paenibacillus, and Streptomyces spp. Composition of the Streptomyces community shifted significantly, as determined by PCR denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, resulting in an increase in the dominance of a specific population in suppressive soils after only 3 days. This shift was related mainly to the increase in Streptomyces humidus, a group previously described as antagonistic to phytopathogenic fungi. Thus, suitable soil amendment resulted in a shift in the root's bacterial communities, and infection by a virulent pathogen was contained by the root microbiome, leading to a reduced disease rate.},

  abstract = {Barley yellow dwarf (BYD) is one of the most important wheat diseases in the state of Kansas. Several methods of disease management have been recommended to mitigate losses from BYD including the use of seed-treatment insecticides, delayed planting of winter wheat, and deploying cultivars with resistance to BYD. The goal of this research was to quantify the impact of these three management strategies, alone and in combination, on BYD disease progress and grain yields in Kansas. When field experiments were averaged over four years, treating seed with the insecticide imidacloprid (Gaucho) reduced the daily increase in the area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) by 35.0\% and corresponding yield losses from BYD by 16.4\%. Compared with early planting, late planting reduced AUDPC by 47.9\% and corresponding yield losses by 57.5\%. Planting a moderately resistant cultivar reduced AUDPC by 80.9\% and corresponding yield losses by 72.6\% compared with a susceptible cultivar. When all three BYD management methods were combined, BYD was reduced by 95.2\% and yield losses reduced by 97.1\% when compared with not using any of the management methods. Therefore, integrating management practices can result in high levels of control of BYD in Kansas.

Fungicides containing ametoctradin + dimethomorph and fluopicolide were the most effective among tested products in both experiments across eight trial parameters (inoculum type, inoculation time after treatment, and fungicide application site). Other active ingredients, including acibenzolar-S-methyl, dimethomorph, fenamidone, ethaboxam, mandipropamid, mefenoxam, and oxathiapiprolin, were most effective in reducing stem lesion growth in three to seven of the eight trial parameters evaluated. Compared to nontreated plants, stem lesion inhibition ranged from 84.1 to 100\%.

Each year seedlings were transplanted in April and heads harvested in June/July. In 2010, Romaine types had significantly (P {\textless} 0.0001) greater incidence of gray mold (caused by Botrytis cinerea) than other types. In 2011, incidence of gray mold was significantly (P = 0.004) greater in high tunnel than open field plots, and greatest in high tunnels when fog persisted. All cultivars were equally susceptible to lettuce drop (caused by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum), although in 2012, incidence was significantly (P {\textless} 0.0001) greater in high tunnel than open field plots. ‘Green Star’ (Leaf type) had reduced incidence of gray mold and lettuce drop in 2010 and 2011. Incidence of tipburn was significantly (P = 0.032 and P = 0.001, respectively) greater in the high tunnels in 2011 and 2012 compared to the open field. Total yield (kg) was greater in the open field in 2012, but not in 2011 and 2010.

  abstract = {Watermelon is an economically important crop in China and is commonly affected by Alternaria-like leaf blight that can result in significant economic losses. In this study, 830 Alternaria isolates, recovered from symptomatic watermelon leaves, were identified based on morphological traits, pathogenicity, and multilocus sequence analyses of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), histone 3 (HIS3), the internal transcribed spacer of ribosomal DNA (rDNA ITS), and the RNA polymerase II second largest subunit (RPB2). Watermelon isolates grouped to five Alternaria species and one unclassified Alternaria species. They were A. tenuissima, A. alternata, A. cucumerina, A. infectoria, A. gaisen, and Alternaria sp. Notably, A. tenuissima was the most prevalent (73.5\%) of the six isolated species, followed by A. alternata (25.0\%), A. cucumerina (1.1\%), Alternaria sp. (0.2\%), A. infectoria (0.1\%), and A. gaisen (0.1\%). Pathogenicity tests demonstrated that all six Alternaria species could produce brown necrotic lesions on detached leaves of watermelon. The average disease incidence (75.1\%) and average disease index (60.8) of watermelon resulting from inoculation of leaves with A. cucumerina were significantly higher than levels resulting from A. alternata (52.9\% and 37.2) and A. tenuissima (47.5\% and 30.8). Inoculation with Alternaria sp. resulted in a disease incidence (70.0\%) and disease index (51.5), which were lower than those of A. cucumerina. The disease incidence and disease index in watermelon leaves inoculated with the one isolate of A. infectoria and the one isolate of A. gaisen present in the inoculated leaves were 28.9\% and 16.4, and 48.9\% and 31.4, respectively. Results of the study indicate that Alternaria species associated with watermelon leaf blight in China are more diverse than that has been previously reported. This is the first report globally of A. infectoria, A. gaisen, and an unclassified Alternaria species as causal agents of leaf blight on watermelon.},

  abstract = {Sudden death syndrome (SDS) of soybean is caused by a soilborne pathogen, Fusarium virguliforme. Phytotoxins produced by F. virguliforme are translocated from infected roots to leaves, in which they cause SDS foliar symptoms. In this study, additional putative phytotoxins of F. virguliforme were identified, including three secondary metabolites and 11 effectors. While citrinin, fusaric acid, and radicicol induced foliar chlorosis and wilting, Soybean mosaic virus (SMV)-mediated overexpression of F. virguliforme necrosis-inducing secreted protein 1 (FvNIS1) induced SDS foliar symptoms that mimicked the development of foliar symptoms in the field. The expression level of fvnis1 remained steady over time, although foliar symptoms were delayed compared with the expression levels. SMV::FvNIS1 also displayed genotype-specific toxicity to which 75 of 80 soybean cultivars were susceptible. Genome-wide association mapping further identified three single nucleotide polymorphisms at two loci, where three leucine-rich repeat receptor-like protein kinase (LRR-RLK) genes were found. Culture filtrates of fvnis1 knockout mutants displayed a mild reduction in phytotoxicity, indicating that FvNIS1 is one of the phytotoxins responsible for SDS foliar symptoms and may contribute to the quantitative susceptibility of soybean by interacting with the LRR-RLK genes.},

  abstract = {A highly virulent race 4 (Cal race 4) of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. vasinfectum was identified in California cotton fields in 2001, and has since been found in increasing numbers of fields. Cal race 4 isolates contain a unique Tfo1 transposon insertion in the PHO gene that was not found in other F. oxysporum f. sp. vasinfectum genotypes. Based on this insertion, a multiplex polymerase chain reaction method was developed to detect the Cal race 4 pathogen. A panel of F. oxysporum f. sp. vasinfectum isolates representing different vegetative compatibility groups (VCG) and DNA sequence types was assembled to test the specificity of the detection method. In all, 16 of 17 Cal race 4 isolates produced a 583-bp amplicon; the other isolate produced a 396-bp amplicon reflecting the absence of the Tfo1 insertion. This isolate was a moderately virulent pathogen among Cal race 4 isolates. In total, 80 other F. oxysporum isolates associated with cotton and 11 other formae speciales of F. oxysporum produced only the 396-bp amplicon. The method also distinguished Cal race 4 isolates from India race 4 isolates and China race 7 isolates, which did not possess the unique Tfo1 insertion but otherwise had identical DNA sequences, and all belong to VCG0114. The method is capable of detecting the pathogen directly from infected stem tissues even before external symptom appears and, thus, provides an effective tool for timely identification of infested fields and seed lots, and should help reduce dissemination of Cal race 4 in the U.S. Cotton Belt.},

Insertions occurred both in gene-dense and gene-sparse regions but disproportionately near the 5′ ends of genes, which disrupted native coding sequences. Microhomology at the recombination site between plasmid and chromosome was common. Studies of transformants silenced for 12 different gene targets indicated that neighbors within 500 nt were often cosilenced, regardless of whether hairpin or sense constructs were employed and the direction of transcription of the target. However, this cis spreading of silencing did not occur in all transformants obtained with the same plasmid. Genome-wide studies indicated that unlinked genes with partial complementarity with the silencing-inducing transgene were not usually down-regulated. We learned that hairpin or sense transgenes were not cosilenced with the target in all transformants, which informs how screens for silencing should be performed. We conclude that transformation and gene silencing can be reliable tools for functional genomics in Phytophthora spp. but must be used carefully, especially by testing for the spread of silencing to genes flanking the target.},

              Background
              
                Wheat yellow mosaic virus
                (WYMV) is an important pathogen in China and other countries. It is the member of the genus
                Bymovirus
                and transmitted primarily by
                Polymyxa graminis
                . The incidence of wheat infections in endemic areas has risen in recent years. Prompt and dependable identification of WYMV is a critical component of response to suspect cases.
              
            
            
              Methods
              In this study, a one step real-time RT-PCR, followed by standard curve analysis for the detection and identification of WYMV, was developed. Two reference genes, 18s RNA and β-actin were selected in order to adjust the veracity of the real-time RT-PCR assay.

                We developed a one-step Taqman-based real-time quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) assay targeting the conserved region of the 879 bp long full-length WYMV coat protein gene. The accuracy of normalized data was analyzed along with appropriate internal control genes: β-actin and 18s rRNA which were included in detecting of WYMV-infected wheat leaf tissues. The detectable end point sensitivity in RT-qPCR assay was reaching the minimum limit of the quantitative assay and the measurable copy numbers were about 30 at10
                6
                -fold dilution of total RNA. This value was close to 10
                4
                -fold more sensitive than that of indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. More positive samples were detected by RT-qPCR assay than gel-based RT-PCR when detecting the suspected samples collected from 8 regions of China. Based on presented results, RT-qPCR will provide a valuable method for the quantitative detection of WYMV.
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              The Taqman-based RT-qPCR assay is a faster, simpler, more sensitive and less expensive procedure for detection and quantification of WYMV than other currently used methods.},

              was analysed. However, comparable data are lacking for adult males and second-stage juveniles (J2). Therefore, our studies of four
              M. chitwoodi
              isolates from the western USA, representing all currently known races and pathotypes, were designed to characterise intraspecific morphological variability in J2 and males and to compare it to variability found in adult females. Multivariate analysis of variance indicated statistically significant variation among isolates for both J2 and males. Moreover, for adult males, canonical discriminant analysis grouped races with their respective pathotypes. In addition, we analysed two morphological features that were previously uncharacterised for
              M. chitwoodi
              ,
              i.e.
              , stylet knob width and distance from secretory-excretory pore to anterior end. Both of these characters may be useful in distinguishing
              M. chitwoodi
              from closely related species. SEM clearly showed the presence of areolations along the bodies of J2, thereby separating

Understanding the mechanisms of resistance to this nematode species in known resistant rice genotypes may help to improve rice genotypes, aiming at developing and implementing environment-friendly and cost-effective nematode management strategies. Using susceptible and resistant rice genotypes, a comparative analysis of histological response mechanisms was made during two phases of the nematode colonisation:
              i
              ) root penetration; and
              ii
              ) subsequent establishment and development by
              M. graminicola
              second-stage juveniles (J2). Two types of defence response mechanisms could be distinguished in the resistant rice genotypes. The early defence response consisted of a hypersensitive response (HR)-like reaction in the early stage of infection characterised by necrosis of cells directly affected by nematode feeding. This HR-like reaction was observed only in the
              M. graminicola
              -resistant
              Oryza glaberrima

              O. sativa
              genotypes. The late defence response took place after the induction of giant cells by the J2. Giant cells usually collapsed and degenerated before J2 developed into adults. Structural features of the roots of the susceptible

              showed greater root and stele diam. and cortex thickness than the resistant

              Nematode body neutral lipid (triacylglycerol) content has been related to infectivity and has direct implications in control strategies. In this study,
              Pratylenchus brachyurus
              populations were split into two groups:
              i
              ) freshly hatched second-stage juveniles (J2) containing lipids stored during embryogenesis;
              ii
              ) third- and fourth-stage juveniles (J3/J4) plus females that replenished their lipid reserves by feeding on maize (
              Zea mays
              ) roots. These groups were subjected to starvation to study their lipid consumption dynamics by staining with Oil Red O, which binds specifically to neutral lipids. Before starvation, freshly hatched J2 had 27\% of their body area stained, whereas J3/J4 and females had 75\%. Freshly hatched J2 starved for 28 days at 25°C in water lost 63.8\% of the original neutral lipid content, which caused a reduction of 91\% of infectivity in maize roots. By contrast, J3/J4 and females exposed to the same conditions lost 56.7\% of the original neutral lipid content, which resulted in less than 50\% reduction in infectivity. During the period of food deprivation, J2 had a mean daily neutral lipid consumption rate of 0.63\% and the other infectious stages (J3/J4 and females) had a mean daily neutral lipid consumption rate of 1.46\% per day. This study adds information on the dynamics of lipid utilisation that supports the use of longer waiting periods for planting crops after fallow in soils infested with

  abstract = {DNA extraction from minute fungal samples is challenging in all genetic studies. Identification of genetic groups and population biology mostly rely on the laborious production of single conidium isolates or on field samples, including infected plant materials. This paper reports a simple and cost-effective protocol for DNA extraction from individual chasmothecia of Erysiphe necator for subsequent applications. It is a less laborious alternative for genotyping purposes than production and analysis of single conidium isolates or analysis of infected plant material from the field. Using the protocols described here for 186 E. necator samples tested, genetic groups A and B were assigned. Based on CYP51 sequences, all the samples belonged to group B, while TUB2 sequences exhibited SNPs also diagnostic for group A. Additionally, a quantitative real-time PCR detection method of single nucleotide polymorphism in the CYP51 gene associated with DMI fungicide resistance was applied. The A495T marker, associated with DMI resistance, and here reported for the first time from Hungary, was detected by quantitative real-time PCR assays and direct sequencing of CYP51. The methods developed in this study can be applied as routine tests to monitor powdery mildew populations for fungicide resistance and other genetic characteristics.},

              Meloidogyne
              spp., cause serious diseases in various plants and their chemical control may lead to environmental problems. Therefore, alternative control measures against the phytopathogenic nematodes are being sought. One of the potential targets against
              Meloidogyne
              spp. may be the chitinolysis and degradation of nematode eggs. Therefore, in the present study, a chitinolytic and nematicidal strain of
              Lysobacter capsici
              YS1215 was isolated from an agricultural field in Korea. The aim of this study was to purify chitinase secreted by
              L. capsici
              YS1215 and investigate its nematicidal role against
              Meloidogyne incognita
              . The chitinase secreted by
              L. capsici
              YS1215 was purified by protein precipitation with 80\% ammonium sulphate, anion-exchange chromatography with DEAE-cellulose and gel-filtration chromatography with Sephadex G-100. By chitinase-active staining of the purified enzyme, a single band was obtained with an estimated molecular mass of 43.6 kDa. The optimal pH and optimal temperature for the highest chitinase activity were 6.0 and 40°C, respectively. The purified chitinase degraded the chitin layer of the eggshells and significantly reduced hatch of second-stage juveniles. The activity of chitinase secreted by
              L. capsici
              YS1215 was not affected by CoCl

              or EDTA. The purified enzyme could also hydrolyse swollen chitin, glycol chitin, glycol chitosan and chitin powder. Thus, the role of chitinase secreted by
              L. capsici
              YS1215 against
              Meloidogyne

AsES activates innate immunity and confers resistance against anthracnose and gray mold diseases in strawberry plants (Fragaria × ananassa Duch.) and the last disease also in Arabidopsis. In the present work, we show that, upon AsES recognition, a cascade of defense responses is activated, including: calcium influx, biphasic oxidative burst (O

All these responses occurred following a spatial and temporal program, first induced in infiltrated leaflets (local acquired resistance), spreading out to untreated lateral leaflets, and later, to distal leaves (systemic acquired resistance). After AsES treatment, macro-HR and macro–oxidative bursts were localized in infiltrated leaflets, while micro-HRs and microbursts occurred later in untreated leaves, being confined to a single cell or a cluster of a few epidermal cells that differentiated from the surrounding ones. The differentiated cells initiated a time-dependent series of physiological and anatomical changes, evolving to idioblasts accumulating H

This kind of systemic cell-death process in plants is described for the first time in response to a single elicitor. All data presented in this study suggest that AsES has the potential to activate a wide spectrum of biochemical and molecular defense responses in F. ananassa that may explain the induced protection toward pathogens of opposite lifestyle, like hemibiotrophic and necrotrophic fungi.},

WSMV is not a chronic problem of annual wheat in the United States Pacific Northwest but could negatively affect the establishment of perennial wheat, which is being developed as an alternative to annual wheat to prevent soil erosion. Fifty local isolates of WSMV were collected from 2008 to 2010 near Lewiston, ID, Pullman, WA, and the United States Department of Agriculture Central Ferry Research Station, near Pomeroy, WA to determine the amount of genetic variation present in the region. The coat protein gene from each isolate was sequenced and the data subjected to four different methods of phylogenetic analyses. Two well-supported clades of WSMV were identified. Isolates in clade I share sequence similarity with isolates from Central Europe; this is the first report of isolates from Central Europe being reported in the United States. Isolates in clade II are similar to isolates originating from Australia, Argentina, and the American Pacific Northwest. Nine isolates showed evidence of recombination and the same two well-supported clades were observed when recombinant isolates were omitted from the analysis. More polymorphic sites, parsimony informative sites, and increased diversity were observed in clade II than clade I, suggesting more recent establishment of the virus in the latter. The observed diversity within both clades could make breeding for durable disease resistance in perennial wheat difficult if there is a differential response of WSMV resistance genes to isolates from different clades.},

  abstract = {Fusarium spp. are ranked among the top 10 most economically and scientifically important plant-pathogenic fungi in the world and are associated with plant diseases that include fruit decay of a number of crops. Fusarium isolates infecting bell pepper in Trinidad were identified based on sequence comparisons of the translation elongation factor gene (EF-1a) with sequences of Fusarium incarnatum-equiseti species complex (FIESC) verified in the FUSARIUM-ID database. Eighty-two isolates were identified as belonging to one of four phylogenetic species within the subclades FIESC-1, FIESC-15, FIESC-16, and FIESC-26, with the majority of isolates belonging to FIESC-15. A comparison of the level of DNA polymorphism and phylogenetic inference for sequences of the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2) and EF-1a sequences for Trinidad and FUSARIUM-ID type species was carried out. The ITS sequences were less informative, had lower haplotype diversity and restricted haplotype distribution, and resulted in poor resolution and taxa placement in the consensus maximum-likelihood tree. EF-1a sequences enabled strongly supported phylogenetic inference with highly resolved branching patterns of the 30 phylogenetic species within the FIESC and placement of representative Trinidad isolates. Therefore, global phylogeny was inferred from EF-1a sequences representing 11 countries, and separation into distinct Incarnatum and Equiseti clades was again evident. In total, 42 haplotypes were identified: 12 were shared and the remaining were unique haplotypes. The most diverse haplotype was represented by sequences from China, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Trinidad and consisted exclusively of F. incarnatum isolates. Spain had the highest haplotype diversity, perhaps because both F. equiseti and F. incarnatum sequences were represented; followed by the United States, which contributed both F. equiseti and F. incarnatum sequences to the data set; then by countries representing Southeast Asia (China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Philippines) and Trinidad; both of these regions were represented by only F. incarnatum sequences. Trinidad shared two haplotypes with China and one haplotype with the United States for only F. incarnatum isolates. The findings of this study are important for devising disease management strategies and for understanding the phylogenetic relationships among members of the FIESC.},

MLS severity was significantly lower in the leaves of plants from ECVSCS155 relative to the leaves of plants from HIB 32R48H. In both cultivars, net CO

              concentration ratio increased in inoculated plants relative to noninoculated plants. The initial fluorescence and nonphotochemical quenching significantly increased in inoculated plants of ECVSCS155 and HIB 32R48H, respectively, relative to noninoculated plants. The maximum fluorescence, maximum PSII quantum efficiency, coefficient for photochemical quenching, and electron transport rate significantly decreased in inoculated plants relative to noninoculated plants. For both cultivars, concentrations of total chlorophyll (Chl) (a + b) and carotenoids and the Chl a/b ratio significantly decreased in inoculated plants relative to noninoculated plants. In conclusion, the results from the present study demonstrate, for the first time, that photosynthesis in the leaves of maize plants is dramatically affected during the infection process of S. macrospora, and impacts are primarily associated with limitations of a diffusive and biochemical nature.},

  abstract = {Phytophthora pluvialis is an oomycete that was first isolated from soil, water, and tree foliage in mixed Douglas-fir−tanoak forests of the U.S. Pacific Northwest (PNW). It was then identified as the causal agent of red needle cast of radiata pine (Pinus radiata) in New Zealand (NZ). Genotyping-by-sequencing was used to obtain 1,543 single nucleotide polymorphisms across 145 P. pluvialis isolates to characterize the population structure in the PNW and NZ. We tested the hypothesis that P. pluvialis was introduced to NZ from the PNW using genetic distance measurements and population structure analyses among locations between countries. The low genetic distance, population heterozygosity, and lack of geographic structure in NZ suggest a single colonization event from the United States followed by clonal expansion in NZ. The PNW Coast Range was proposed as a presumptive center of origin of the currently known distribution of P. pluvialis based on its geographic range and position as the central cluster in a minimum spanning network. The Coastal cluster of isolates were located at the root of every U.S. cluster and emerged earlier than all NZ clusters. The Coastal cluster had the highest degree of heterozygosity (Hs = 0.254) and median pairwise genetic distance (0.093) relative to any other cluster. Finally, the rapid host diversification between closely related isolates of P. pluvialis in NZ indicate that this pathogen has the potential to infect a broader range of hosts than is currently recognized.},

  abstract = {Epidemics of tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV; species Tomato yellow leaf curl begomovirus) have been problematic to tomato production in the southeastern United States since the first detection of the virus in Florida in the late 1990s. Current strategies for management focus on farm-centric tactics that have had limited success for controlling either TYLCV or its whitefly vector. Areawide pest management (AWPM)—loosely defined as a coordinated effort to implement management strategies on a regional scale—may be a viable management alternative. A prerequisite for development of an AWPM program is an understanding of the spatial and temporal dynamics of the target pathogen and pest populations. The objective of this study was to characterize populations of whitefly and TYLCV in commercial tomato production fields in southwestern Florida and utilize this information to develop predictors of whitefly density and TYLCV disease incidence as a function of environmental and geographical factors. Scouting reports were submitted by cooperating growers located across approximately 20,000 acres in southwestern Florida from 2006 to 2012. Daily weather data were obtained from several local weather stations. Moran’s I was used to assess spatial relationships and polynomial distributed lag regression was used to determine the relationship between weather variables, whitefly, and TYLCV. Analyses showed that the incidence of TYLCV increased proportionally with mean whitefly density as the season progressed. Nearest-neighbor analyses showed a strong linear relationship between the logarithms of whitefly densities in neighboring fields. A similar relationship was found with TYLCV incidences. Correlograms based on Moran’s I showed that these relationships extended beyond neighboring fields and out to approximately 2.5 km for TYLCV and up to 5 km for whitefly, and that values of I were generally higher during the latter half of the production season for TYLCV. Weather was better at predicting whitefly density than at predicting TYLCV incidence. Whitefly density was best predicted by the number of days with an average temperature between 16 and 24°C (T16to24), relative humidity (RH) over the previous 31 days, and vapor pressure deficit over the last 8 days. TYLCV incidence was best predicted by T16to24, RH, and maximum wind speed over the previous 31 days. Results of this study helped to identify the extent to which populations of whitefly and TYLCV exist over the agricultural landscape of southwestern Florida, and the environmental conditions that favor epidemic growth. This information was used to propose an approach to AWPM for timing control measures for managing TYLCV epidemics.},

L. asiaticus’ is incurable; therefore, knowledge regarding ‘Ca. L. asiaticus’ biology and pathogenesis is essential to develop a treatment. However, ‘Ca. L. asiaticus’ cannot currently be successfully cultured, limiting its study. To gain insight into the conditions conducive for growth of ‘Ca. L. asiaticus’ in vitro, ‘Ca. L. asiaticus’ inoculum obtained from seed of fruit from infected pomelo trees (Citrus maxima ‘Mato Buntan’) was added to different media, and cell viability was monitored for up to 2 months using quantitative polymerase chain reaction in conjunction with ethidium monoazide. Media tested included one-third King's B (K), K with 50\% juice from the infected fruit, K with 50\% commercially available grapefruit juice, and 100\% commercially available grapefruit juice. Results show that juice-containing media dramatically prolong viability compared with K in experiments reproduced during 2 years using different juice sources. Furthermore, biofilm formed at the air–liquid interface of juice cultures contained ‘Ca. L. asiaticus’ cells, though next-generation sequencing indicated that other bacterial genera were predominant. Chemical characterization of the media was conducted to discuss possible factors sustaining ‘Ca. L. asiaticus’ viability in vitro, which will contribute to future development of a culture medium for ‘Ca. L. asiaticus’.},

  abstract   = {Hop downy mildew (caused by Pseudoperonospora humuli) is a yield-limiting disease in many hop-production regions of the world. In this research, 110 cultivars that are or were widely grown in the United States, Europe, or Australasia were evaluated in western Oregon over three years for their reaction to the shoot infection phase of downy mildew and vigor. There was a large range of downy mildew susceptibility and vigor amongst commercial cultivars, with some cultivars possessing a very high level of resistance. Overall, however, disease resistance and vigor were significantly greater in cultivars originating from Europe than those originating from the United States, Japan, and Australia/New Zealand. Amongst a subset of 79 cultivars, vigor was negatively correlated with levels, in cones, of cohumulone, a chemical constitute of bittering acids typically found in germplasm derived from North America. The generally poor vigor observed in cultivars derived outside of Europe likely is indicative of a lack of tolerance to the crown infection phase of the disease. Thus, the best sources of downy mildew resistance seems to be found in cultivars from the United Kingdom and continental Europe, and such cultivars are typically lower yielding and lack distinctive aroma and flavor characteristics presently desired by craft brewers. Introgression of downy mildew resistance into North American germplasm with high yield and desirable brewing characteristics is needed.

  abstract = {One hundred thirty-five single-spore isolates were collected from grape vineyards from 15 provinces or autonomous regions belonging to five viticulture climatic zones in China. All the isolates were identified as Botrytis cinerea based on their morphological and molecular characters. The 135 isolates were all heterothallic isolates. Seventy-one isolates belonged to the MAT1-1 type and 64 were characterized to MAT1-2 type. All the isolates studied belonged to Group II based on PCR-RFLP of the Bc-hch locus. The four TE genotypes, transposa, Boty-only, Flipper-only, and vacuma, comprised 51.9\%, 33.3\%, 10.4\%, and 4.5\%, respectively, of the total population. The frequency of transposa was highest in the total population and the most of any subpopulation (each viticulture climatic zone), and Boty-only was highest in warm areas (46.2\%). Vacuma was mainly distributed in northern China, although in small amounts, and Flipper-only was mainly was distributed in humid tropical areas (42.9\%). A microsatellite analysis of B. cinerea populations was performed to assess the genetic population structure. A total of 127 different MLGs were identified among 135 B. cinerea isolates, with a genotypic diversity of 0.9991. The transposa population isolates showed higher genetic diversity than other populations. Pairwise tests of genetic differentiation among four TE-type populations yielded generally low to high Gst values. All isolates belonged to two genetic clusters. The population microsatellite diversity and genetic structure had a certain correlation with the TE type and geographic origin. This is the first report of the genotypic diversity of B. cinerea isolates from grape vineyards across China.},

              Background
              
                Beet black scorch virus
                (BBSV) is a small single-stranded, positive-sense RNA plant virus belonging to the genus
                Necrovirus
                , family
                Tombusviridae
                . Its capsid protein (CP) contains a 13 amino acid long basic region at the N-terminus, rich in arginine and lysine residues, which is thought to interact with viral RNA to initiate virion assembly.
              
            
            
              Results
              
                In the current study, a series of BBSV mutants containing amino acid substitutions as well as deletions within the N-terminal region were generated and examined for their effects on viral RNA replication, virion assembly, and long distance spread in protoplasts and whole host plants of BBSV. The RNA-binding activities of the mutated CPs were also evaluated
                in vitro
                . These experiments allowed us to identify two key basic amino acid residues in this region that are responsible for initiating virus assembly through RNA-binding. Proper assembly of BBSV particles is in turn needed for efficient viral systemic movement.
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              We have identified two basic amino acid residues near the N-terminus of the BBSV CP that bind viral RNA with high affinity to initiate virion assembly. We further provide evidence showing that systemic spread of BBSV in infected plants requires intact virions. This study represents the first in-depth investigation of the role of basic amino acid residues within the N-terminus of a necroviral CP.},

La distribución espacial de la antracnosis en el cultivo de aguacate mostró diferencias en cada uno de los municipios evaluados, ajustándose a diferentes modelos geoestadísticos (gaussiano, esférico y exponencial), mismos que fueron validados mediante el método de validación cruzada. La distribución espacial de la antracnosis se obtuvo con mapas elaborados a través del krigeado ordinario. Estos mapas revelaron que el municipio de Tenancingo presentó la mayor densidad de antracnosis, respecto a los municipios de Coatepec Harinas, Temascaltepec y Donato Guerra. La distribución espacial de la antracnosis en los cuatro municipios presento agregación y focos de infección localizados.

The diversity of species that cause common scab is unknown. Likewise, the genomic context necessary for bacteria to incite common scab symptom development is not fully characterized. Here, we phenotyped and sequenced the genomes of five strains from a poorly studied Streptomyces lineage. These strains form a new species-level group. When genome sequences within just these five strains are compared, there are no polymorphisms of loci implicated in virulence. Each genome contains the pathogenicity island that encodes for the production of thaxtomin A, a phytotoxin necessary for common scab. Yet, not all sequenced strains produced thaxtomin A. Strains varied from nonpathogenic to highly virulent on two hosts. Unexpectedly, one strain that produced thaxtomin A and was pathogenic on radish was not aggressively pathogenic on potato. Therefore, while thaxtomin A biosynthetic genes and production of thaxtomin A are necessary, they are not sufficient for causing common scab of potato. Additionally, results show that even within a species-level group of Streptomyces strains, there can be aggressively pathogenic and nonpathogenic strains despite conservation of virulence genes.},

  abstract = {Members of the Botryosphaeriaceae family are known to cause Bot gummosis on many woody plants worldwide. To identify pathogens associated with Bot gummosis on citrus in California, scion and rootstock samples were collected in 2010 and 2011 from five citrus-growing counties in California. Symptoms observed on citrus included branch cankers, dieback, and gumming. Various fungal species were recovered from necrotic tissues of branch canker and rootstock samples. Species were identified morphologically and by phylogenetic comparison as ‘Eureka’ lemon, ‘Valencia’, ‘Washington Navel’, ‘Fukumoto’, grapefruit, ‘Satsuma’, and ‘Meyer’ lemon. Species were identified morphologically and by phylogenetic comparison of the complete sequence of the internal transcribed spacer regions, β-tubulin gene, and elongation factor α-1 genes with those of other species in GenBank. A consensus-unrooted most parsimonious tree resulting from multigene phylogenetic analysis showed the existence of three major clades in the Botryosphaeriaceae family. In total, 74 isolates were identified belonging to the Botryosphaeriaceae family, with Neofusicoccum spp., Dothiorella spp., Diplodia spp., (teleomorph Botryosphaeria), Lasiodiplodia spp., and Neoscytalidium dimidiatum (teleomorphs unknown) accounting for 39, 25, 23, 10, and 3\% of the total, respectively. On inoculated Eureka lemon shoots, lesion length was significantly different (P {\textless} 0.05) among 14 isolates recovered from portions of cankered tissues of the original trees. Lesion lengths were significantly longer (P {\textless} 0.05) for shoots inoculated with isolates of Neofusicoccum luteum and shorter for shoots inoculated with isolates of Dothiorella viticola (P {\textless} 0.05) than those of other species. Identifying the distribution and occurrence of these fungal pathogens associated with Bot gummosis is useful for management applications during occasional outbreaks in California.},

            Surveillance for insect-transmitted pathogens of plants involves sampling insects in the field, followed by transport of the samples to the laboratory for DNA extraction and molecular analysis. Sample transport and DNA extraction are time consuming and can delay the implementation of measures to mitigate the effects of insect-transmitted plant pathogens. Looking for a fast and reliable method to extract DNA in the field where insects were collected, we used Flinders Technology Associates PlantSaver cards, which are designed for plant DNA extraction. Insect DNA extraction can be achieved in the field, and extracted DNA can be amplified using the field-adaptable method, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), in less than 1 h. Additionally, we demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of the paper extraction method for molecular identification to the species level using mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase 1 amplification and sequencing on 11 genera of insects including beetles, leafhoppers, flies, psyllids, and aphids. The method was suitable for insects collected using three common methods: live-trapped and frozen, stored in ethanol, or trapped on sticky cards. Moreover, by testing leafhoppers collected in 2018 in the field, we demonstrated that the LAMP assay using the chaperonin-60 target detects a higher proportion of samples positive for ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma asteris’ than conventional PCR targeting 16S rRNA. Lastly, the paper extraction method was used to determine the prevalence of leafhoppers carrying the plant pathogenic bacterium ‘Ca. P. asteris’, which causes aster yellows from a laboratory-reared colony using PCR-based tests (conventional PCR, qPCR, and droplet digital PCR) and the non-PCR-based LAMP assay.},

  abstract = {Root-knot nematodes (RKNs; Meloidogyne spp.) and Ralstonia solanacearum, the causal agent of bacterial wilt, are major soilborne pathogens in U.S. tomato production. Methyl bromide has been used for decades to effectively manage RKN but its phase-out and the high cost of other effective fumigants such as 1,3-dichloropropene has resulted in a need to develop sustainable alternatives. Many of the commercially popular varieties used by the tomato industry do not have resistance to RKNs and R. solanacearum. Recent studies worldwide have shown the potential for grafting using resistant rootstocks as a sustainable and ecofriendly practice for R. solanacearum management. However, the effectiveness of R. solanacearum-resistant rootstocks on RKN management is not known. In this study, three commercially available R. solanacearum-resistant tomato rootstocks (‘RST-04-106-T’, ‘BHN 998’, and ‘BHN 1054’) were evaluated for resistance to Meloidogyne incognita in field tomato production in four field trials conducted for two consecutive years in two geographical locations: Florida and Virginia. Grafting rootstocks onto ‘BHN 602’ a tomato scion susceptible to bacterial wilt and RKNs, significantly reduced root galling caused by RKNs in all four field trials and increased yield in two of the trials compared with the nongrafted treatment. This study demonstrates the potential of grafting for managing multiple soilborne pathogens using the same rootstocks.},

  abstract = {Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici and P. striiformis f. sp. hordei, the causal agents of stripe rust on wheat and barley, respectively, can change rapidly in virulence, and such changes may overcome resistance in cultivars and result in severe epidemics. To monitor virulence changes in the pathogen populations, isolates obtained from stripe rust samples collected by the authors and collaborators from 17 U.S. states in 2008 and 13 states in 2009 were tested on 20 wheat and 12 barley differential lines to identify races of P. striiformis f. tritici and P. striiformis f. sp. hordei, respectively. In 2008, 33 P. striiformis f. tritici (PST) races were detected, including a new race, PST-138, which was similar to previously identified PST-127 (virulent on wheat differentials 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20) but not virulent on differential 8. The five most frequent races were PST-114 (virulent on differentials 1, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20), PST-100 (virulent on differentials 1, 3, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20), PST-116 (similar to PST-114 plus virulent on differential 5), PST-101 (similar to PST-100 plus virulent on differential 2), and PST-98 (similar to PST-100 but not virulent on differential 9). In 2009, 26 P. striiformis f. tritici races were identified, including two new races, PST-139 and PST-140. PST-139 was similar to PST-127 but not virulent on differentials 16 and 20. PST-140 was similar to PST-114 but not virulent on differential 9. The five most frequent races were PST-139 (19\%), PST-140 (14\%), PST-114 (11\%), PST-116 (10\%), and PST-127 (9\%). However, the most widely distributed races were PST-98 (in 10 of the 14 states) and PST-102 (in 7 of the 14 states). Differential genotype AvSYr5NIL (Yr5) was the only one among the 20 differentials that remained resistant to all of the identified races. Virulence diversity of the P. striiformis f. tritici populations was higher west of the Rocky Mountains. For barley stripe rust, P. striiformis f. sp. hordei (PSH)-33 (virulent on barley differentials 1 and 7) was the most common (46\%) of the 11 races detected in 2008, including a new race, PSH-82 (virulent only on barley differentials 1 and 11). In 2009, six previously identified races were detected, of which five (PSH-16, PSH-38, PSH-46, PSH-54, and PSH-71) were detected in Washington and two (PSH-54 and PSH-70) in Oregon. The information on P. striiformis f. sp. tritici and P. striiformis f. sp. hordei races should be useful in selecting genes for developing cultivars with effective stripe rust resistance.},

  abstract = {Cross-spectral analysis was used to characterize the relationship between climate variability, represented by atmospheric patterns, and annual fluctuations of Fusarium head blight (FHB) disease intensity in wheat. Time series investigated were the Oceanic Niño Index (ONI), which is a measure of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Pacific-North American (PNA) pattern and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), which are known to have strong influences on the Northern Hemisphere climate, and FHB disease intensity observations in Ohio from 1965 to 2010 and in Indiana from 1973 to 2008. For each climate variable, mean climate index values for the boreal winter (December to February) and spring (March to May) were utilized. The spectral density of each time series and the (squared) coherency of each pair of FHB–climate-index series were estimated. Significance for coherency was determined by a nonparametric permutation procedure. Results showed that winter and spring ONI were significantly coherent with FHB in Ohio, with a period of about 5.1 years (as well as for some adjacent periods). The estimated phase-shift distribution indicated that there was a generally negative relation between the two series, with high values of FHB (an indication of a major epidemic) estimated to occur about 1 year following low values of ONI (indication of a La Niña); equivalently, low values of FHB were estimated to occur about 1 year after high values of ONI (El Niño). There was also limited evidence that winter ONI had significant coherency with FHB in Indiana. At periods between 2 and 7 years, the PNA and NAO indices were coherent with FHB in both Ohio and Indiana, although results for phase shift and period depended on the specific location, climate index, and time span used in calculating the climate index. Differences in results for Ohio and Indiana were expected because the FHB disease series for the two states were not similar. Results suggest that global climate indices and models could be used to identify potential years with high (or low) risk for FHB development, although the most accurate risk predictions will need to be customized for a region and will also require use of local weather data during key time periods for sporulation and infection by the fungal pathogen.},

  abstract = {The deposition of callose is a common plant defense response to intruding pathogens and part of the plant’s innate immunity. In this study, eight grapevine callose synthase (CalS) genes were identified and characterized. To investigate biological function of CalS in grapevine against the infection of Plasmopara viticola, expression patterns of grapevine CalS family genes were analyzed among resistant/susceptible cultivars. After P. viticola infection, expression of CalS1, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 were significantly modified among the grapevine cultivars. For example, the expression of CalS1 and CalS10 were greatly increased in downy mildew (DM)-immune Muscadinia rotundifolia ‘Carlos’ and ‘Noble’. Transient expression assay with promoters of the CalS1 and CalS10 genes confirmed that they were regulated by the oomycete pathogen P. viticola. CalS1 promoter activity was also significantly up-regulated by ABA in DM-immune M. rotundifolia ‘Noble’, but down-regulated in DM-susceptible Vitis vinifera ‘Chardonnay’. The CalS1 promoter, however, was also down-regulated by GA in ‘Chardonnay’, but not affected in ‘Noble’. The promoter activity of CalS10 was significantly up-regulated by GA in ‘Chardonnay’, but not regulated by ABA at all. It is proposed that CalS1 and CalS10 were involved in grapevine defense against DM disease.},

  abstract = {Soybean (Glycine max) sudden death syndrome (SDS), caused by Fusarium virguliforme, is a key limitation in reaching soybean yield potential, stemming from incomplete disease management through cultural practices and partial host resistance. A fungicidal seed treatment was released in 2014 with the active ingredient fluopyram and was the first chemical management strategy to reduce soybean yield loss stemming from SDS. Although farm level studies have found fluopyram profitable, we were curious to discover whether fluopyram would be beneficial nationally if targeted to soybean fields at risk for SDS yield loss. To estimate economic benefits of fluopyram adoption in SDS at-risk acres, in the light of U.S. public research and outreach from a privately developed product, we applied an economic surplus approach, calculating ex ante net benefits from 2018 to 2032. Through this framework of logistic adoption of fluopyram for alleviation of SDS-associated yield losses, we projected a net benefit of \$5.8 billion over 15 years, considering the costs of public seed treatment research and future extension communication. Although the sensitivity analysis indicates that overall net benefits from fluopyram adoption on SDS at-risk acres are highly dependent upon the market price of soybean, the incidence of SDS, the adoption path, and ceiling of this seed treatment, the net benefits still exceeded \$407 million in the worst-case scenario.},

Owing to a lack of effective control options, these diseases have been difficult to properly manage. Cultivars with partial disease resistance are available for some diseases, but not for all. Furthermore, few chemical products are accessible other than copper-based products, which have proven to be erratic in efficacy, depending on variables such as pathogen involved, disease pressure, and environmental conditions. Therefore, field studies were conducted in western Nebraska for 7 years (13 site years) evaluating newly emerging copper-alternative chemicals for managing these diseases in dry beans. Over this time period, five different products were tested for at least 2 years each and were compared with two commercially available copper compounds (Kocide and MasterCop). The new alternatives included two growth-promoting chemicals (ecoAgra A300, WakeUP Summer), and three contact sanitizers (Goldshield 5, SaniDate, and OxiDate). Treatments with SaniDate and ecoAgra A300 more consistently produced higher yields than other treatments, while not reducing disease incidence. These improvements were achieved primarily under high levels of disease, providing promise for use in production systems in western Nebraska.},

When the fungus was grown in vitro on Czapek medium, olicleistanone was isolated together with some already known phytotoxic diterpenoids identified as sphaeropsidins A, C, and G, and diplopimarane (2-5). Olicleistanone was characterized as 4-ethoxy-6a-methoxy-3,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,8,9,10,11-hexahydrodibenzo[de,g]chromen-7(6aH)-one. When D. olivarum was grown on mineral salt medium it produced (-)-mellein (6), sphaeropsidin A and small amounts of sphaeropsidin G and diplopimarane. Olicleistanone (1) exhibited strong activity against the insect Artemia salina L. (100\% larval mortality) at 100 μg mL-1 but did not exhibit phytotoxic, antifungal or antioomycete activity. Among the metabolites isolated (1-6), sphaeropsidin A (2) was active in all bioassays performed exhibiting strong phytotoxicity on leaves of Phaseolus vulgaris L., Juglans regia L. and Quercus suber L. at 1 mg mL-1. Sphaeropsidin A (2) also completely inhibited mycelium growth of Athelia rolfsii, Diplodia corticola, Phytophthora cambivora and P. lacustris at 200 μg per plug, and was active in the Artemia salina assay. Also in this assay, diplopimarane (5) and sphaeropsidin G (4) were active (100\% larval mortality). Diplopimarane also showed antifungal and antioomycete activities. Athelia rolfsii was the most sensitive species to diplopimarane. Sphaeropsidin C (3) and (-)-mellein (6) were inactive in all bioassays. These results expand knowledge on the metabolic profile of Botryosphaeriaceae, and embody the first characterization of the main secondary metabolites secreted by D. olivarum.},

The etiology of disease and the activity of fungicides against P. niveus are not yet well understood. This study evaluated the ability of P. niveus to infect ‘Gala’ apples growing in a conventionally managed orchard. In addition, the sensitivity of P. niveus isolates to postharvest fungicides difenoconazole, fludioxonil, and pyrimethanil was characterized for isolates from both agricultural and nonagricultural environments. Apples were wounded and mock-inoculated or inoculated with P. niveus in early July. At the time of harvest, 8 weeks after wounding, the inoculated apples had significantly larger lesions than mock-inoculated apples (P {\textless} 0.005). The average diameter of lesions on wound-inoculated apples was 11.17 mm ± 6.82 SD, while the average diameter of mock-inoculated lesions was 3.34 mm ± 1.85 SD. Disease symptoms in the orchard were similar to postharvest symptoms of Paecilomyces rot. Symptoms included a brown, flattened, circular lesion with faint concentric rings. The necrosis of mesocarp was firm and roughly U-shaped. Baseline isolates of P. niveus, from nonagricultural environments, were used to determine the effective fungicide dose at which growth was inhibited by 50\% (EC
              50
              ). Furthermore, fungicide sensitivity of P. niveus isolates was examined using relative growth assays at the mean baseline EC
              50
              values to compare baseline isolates with isolates obtained from commercial apple orchards where they were likely exposed to fungicides. Among the exposed isolates, reduced sensitivity to all fungicides was observed, but significant differences between baseline and exposed isolates were only observed with fludioxonil (P {\textless} 0.0001). This is the first report demonstrating that P. niveus can infect apples that are wound-inoculated in the orchard and that isolates from agricultural environments are less sensitive to common fungicides, especially fludioxonil. This finding may have implications for the control of this postharvest diseases. Whether natural infections of apples by P. niveus is initiated in the orchard or during postharvest has yet to be determined.},

              values was from 0.09 to 3.90 μg/ml with a mean of 0.77 μg/ml, and the log values were distributed normally. A subset of 26 isolates was also tested for boscalid sensitivity on fungicide-treated plants in a greenhouse assay. Higher in vitro EC
              50
              values for boscalid were not correlated with higher percent relative disease severity on boscalid-treated plants. These results provide a starting point for further monitoring of boscalid sensitivity.

            Management of dollar spot, caused by Sclerotinia homoeocarpa, in golf courses relies heavily on application of fungicides. Studies are needed testing the sensitivity of S. homoeocarpa isolates from Kansas to boscalid, a relatively new fungicide, and comparing in vitro sensitivity and actual fungicide efficacy on plants. This study's objective was to test the in vitro sensitivity of 71 Kansas isolates of S. homoeocarpa to boscalid and to compare the results to fungicide performance on plants for a subset of those isolates.},

  abstract = {A small heat-shock protein gene, CpHsp24, of Cryphonectria parasitica was selected based on its expression pattern, which showed that it was tannic acid inducible and that its induction was severely hampered by a hypovirus. The predicted protein sequence of CpHsp24 consisted of a hallmark α-crystalline domain flanked by a variable N-terminal and a short C-terminal region. Disruption of CpHsp24 resulted in a slow growth rate under standard growth conditions. The CpHsp24-null mutant showed enhanced sensitivity to heat shock, which was consistent with Northern and Western analyses displaying the heat-shock induction of the CpHsp24 gene and protein, respectively. Virulence tests on the excised bark revealed a severe decrease in the necrotic area of the CpHsp24-null mutant. When the hypovirus was transferred, virus-containing CpHsp24-null progeny displayed severely retarded growth patterns with hypovirulent characteristics of reduced pigmentation and sporulation. Because the tannic-acid-inducible and hypoviral-suppressible expression and the severely impaired virulence are also characteristics of the laccase3 gene (lac3), lac3 expression in the CpHsp24-null mutant was also examined. The resulting lac3 induction was severely affected in the CpHsp24-null mutant, suggesting that CpHsp24 is important for lac3 induction and that CpHsp24 may act as a molecular chaperone for the lac3 protein.},

From 2008 to 2012, 817 monoconidial isolates of A. alternata from 46 citrus orchards were examined for sensitivity to azoxystrobin (AZ) and pyraclostrobin (PYR). Of the isolates, 57.6\% were resistant to both fungicides, with effective concentration to inhibit 50\% growth (EC
              50
              ) values greater than 5 μg/ml for AZ and 1 μg/ml for PYR. The mean EC
              50
              values for sensitive isolates were 0.139 and 0.020 μg/ml for AZ and PYR, respectively. The EC
              50
              values of both fungicides were highly correlated (P {\textless} 0.0001), indicating cross resistance. The proportion of resistant isolates differed significantly (P {\textless} 0.0001) among cultivars and with QoI application frequency (P {\textless} 0.0001). However, resistance was not significantly related (P = 0.364) to disease severity in the field (low, moderate, and high) or isolate virulence (P = 0.397). The molecular basis for QoI resistance was determined for a subset of 235 isolates using polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism of the cytochrome b gene. All resistant isolates showed the point mutation G143A. Based on the presence of one or two introns, isolates were classified as profile I and profile II, respectively. The resistance frequency was significantly higher (P {\textless} 0.0001) in isolate profile II, suggesting a higher selection pressure for resistant population profile II.},

  abstract   = {Bacterial spot caused by Xanthomonas perforans causes significant damage on tomato in Florida. Due to the presence of copper (Cu)-tolerant X. perforans strains, Cu bactericides are not effective in disease management. Hence, there is a critical need to find alternatives for Cu. Antibacterial activity of magnesium oxide (Nano-MgO), and other metal oxide nanoparticles, were evaluated against a Cu-tolerant and -sensitive X. perforans strain. In vitro experiments demonstrated high antibacterial activity of Nano-MgO against both strains compared with the commercial Cu. The minimum inhibitory concentration of Nano-MgO is 25 µg/ml and the minimum bactericidal concentration is 100 µg/ml against a Cu-tolerant X. perforans strain after 4 h of exposure. Structural changes in the bacterial membrane following exposure to Nano-MgO treatments compared with the controls were observed using transmission electron microscopy. In two greenhouse experiments with a Cu-tolerant strain, bacterial spot severity was significantly reduced by Nano-MgO at 200 µg/ml compared with Cu-ethylene bis-dithiocarbamate (grower standard), and the untreated control (P = 0.05). In three field experiments, Nano-MgO at 200 µg/ml significantly reduced disease severity with no negative impact on yield compared with the untreated control. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometric analysis of the fruit confirmed that Nano-MgO application did not lead to the accumulation of Mg, Cu, Ca, K, Mn, P, and S. This study is the first to demonstrate the potential of Nano-MgO against bacterial spot of tomato.},

  abstract = {Phytophthora crown and root rot (Phytophthora capsici) of summer squash is especially difficult to manage because all commercial cultivars are highly susceptible to P. capsici. Producers have traditionally relied on foliar fungicide applications to control Phytophthora crown and root rot despite their limited efficacy. Soil fungicide applications, including via subsurface drip chemigation, have recently gained interest as a method of improving control of P. capsici infections. In this study, soil drenches and foliar applications of 11 fungicides were compared for control of Phytophthora crown and root rot of summer squash in replicated field and greenhouse trials. Fungicides were applied at 7-day intervals. Incidence (\%) of plant death was assessed from 7 to 42 days post inoculation (dpi) in field trials. Crown rot severity was rated on a scale of 1 (no wilting) to 5 (plant death) from 5 to 21 dpi in greenhouse trials. Results of field and greenhouse trials were similar. Plant death of ‘Cougar’ following inoculation with P. capsici isolate 12889 occurred at all growth stages from first true-leaf to full maturity in field trials. Plant death 42 dpi differed significantly (P ≤ 0.0001) among fungicides and application methods. The fungicide–application method interaction also was significant. Some fungicides were ineffective regardless of application method. In general, soil drenches were more effective than foliar applications at limiting plant death but no treatment completely controlled disease symptoms. Mean plant death 42 dpi was 41\% for soil drenches and 92\% for foliar sprays. Drenches of fluopicolide, mandipropamid, or dimethomorph limited plant death to ≤10\% and prevented yield loss associated with root and crown rot. Foliar applications generally did not reduce plant death compared with the untreated, inoculated control, and were unable to prevent yield loss in field trials. In greenhouse trials, crown rot severity differed significantly (P ≤ 0.0001) among fungicides, application methods, and cultivars when plants were inoculated with P. capsici isolate 12889 or SP98. Crown rot was less severe and disease progress was slower following soil drenches than foliar applications. Some fungicide treatments were more effective on ‘Leopard,’ which was less susceptible to P. capsici than ‘Cougar.’ Soil application methods, including soil drench and drip chemigation, should be evaluated when fungicides are registered for soilborne disease control, because these methods provide better control of Phytophthora crown and root rot than foliar application.},

Mating type distribution, genetic diversity and population structure A. rabiei isolates from western Iran, using specific matting type primers, and ISSR and SSR molecular markers. Two mating types were identified, with the 57\% of isolates belonging to MAT1-1. Ten ISSR markers produced 78 polymorphic bands with an average polymorphism information content (PIC) value of 0.33. Seven SSR markers showed high allelic variation (four to seven alleles) with the average PIC value of 0.61. The generated dendrogram using neighbor joining approach with ISSR and SSR marker data grouped isolates in three clusters. Combined dendrogram and model-based population structure analysis divided the isolates into two distinct populations. No significant correlation was found between geographical origins of isolates and their genetic diversity patterns, although the isolates from North Kermanshah and Kurdistan were closely grouped, and most of isolates from Lorestan and Kermanshah were clustered in a separate group. This relative spatial correlation between geographical locations and A. rabiei grouping indicated high genetic diversity within populations and no significant gene flow between distinctly geographical regions. This suggests the nece0ssity of continuous monitoring of A. rabiei populations in order to design effective chickpea breeding strategies to control the disease.},

The ability of the essential oil from Pimenta racemosa var. racemosa to control bacterial wilt of tomato (R. solanacearum, phylotype IIB/4NPB) was investigated. Lemongrass (chemotype 1)-, aniseed (chemotype 2)-, and clove (chemotype 3)-scented chemotypes of P. racemosa var. racemosa essential oil were tested. Six concentrations of emulsified essential oil (from 0.01 to 0.14\% [v/v]) were evaluated by in vitro culture amendment assays and by in vivo experiments in greenhouse. Chemotype 3 displayed remarkable in vitro antibacterial activity against R. solanacearum, because the minimum inhibitory concentration was only 0.03\%, compared with 0.14\% for chemotypes 1 and 2. In greenhouse experiments, no incidence of bacterial wilt was observed in tomato plants grown in soil treated with chemotype 3 of P. racemosa var. racemosa at a concentration of 0.14\%. In the untreated control soil, 62\% of plants displayed symptoms of bacterial wilt. Treatment with chemotype 3 significantly increased the growth of tomato plants compared with untreated controls. These results suggest that chemotype 3 of P. racemosa var. racemosa essential oil is a good candidate for further development as a soil biofumigant for the control of tomato bacterial wilt.},

  abstract = {Development and use of resistant wheat cultivars is the most practical and economical approach for the control of Fusarium head blight (FHB). In the present study, a population of recombinant inbred lines derived from the cross between ‘AC Brio’ (a Canadian bread wheat cultivar moderately susceptible to FHB) and ‘TC 67’ (an FHB-resistant cultivar derived from Triticum timopheevii) was used to map quantitative trait loci (QTL) for FHB resistance using microsatellite molecular markers. Multiple interval mapping detected several QTL for FHB resistance on the chromosomes 5AL and 6A. The QTL detected in the marker interval of cfd6.1-barc48 on chromosome 5AL explained 10.9, 5.2, and 7.8\% of phenotypic variation for disease incidence (type I resistance), disease severity (a combination of type I and type II resistance), and Fusarium-damaged kernels (FDK) (type IV resistance) under field conditions, respectively. The second QTL mapped to 5AL, in the marker interval of cfd39-cfa2185, explained 19.4 and 20.6\% of phenotypic variation for FDK under field conditions and disease severity in the greenhouse (type II resistance), respectively. The QTL located on chromosome 6A conferred resistance to disease incidence and severity under field conditions and to disease severity in the greenhouse, explaining 6.8 to 11.8\% of phenotypic variation for these traits. Several QTL for agronomic traits were also mapped in this study, including one and two QTL to the chromosomes 2A and 5AL, respectively, all for plant height, and two QTL to chromosome 6A for plant height and flowering date, respectively. The 5AL QTL for FHB resistance mapped in the marker interval of cfd39-cfa2185 in the present study is a novel QTL that originated from T. timopheevii and is reported here for the first time. Further validation of this QTL is required for wheat breeding programs to enhance resistance levels to FHB.},

              relative pathogenicity. Most, but not all, populations were able to reproduce and damage roots on the two widely confirmed sources of resistance, Yangambi km5 and Pisang Jari Buaya. Studies using RAPD techniques furthermore revealed putative markers for nematode virulence. Variation in virulence of
              R. similis
              populations was also demonstrated at the regional (Africa) level. Phylogenetic analysis most closely associated the Uganda populations with populations from Sri Lanka, indicating their likely source of origin. However, genetic variability between Uganda populations also indicate that
              R. similis
              was probably introduced into Uganda on separate occasions from different sources, which may help to explain the causes of variability in banana decline in Uganda. The results of this study have clear implications for the development and deployment of sustainable nematode management practices based on the use of resistance, which could help underpin ongoing management initiatives.},

Several abiotic and biotic factors are involved in disease development, in which Neocosmospora species are important biotic agents. The diversity of Neocosmospora species associated with dry root rot symptoms of Citrus trees cultivated in South Africa was evaluated using morphological and molecular analyses. Multi-locus analysis was conducted, based on fragments of seven loci including: ATP citrate lyase (acl1), calmodulin (cal), internal transcribed spacer region of the rRNA (ITS), large subunit of the rRNA (LSU), RNA polymerase largest subunit (rpb1), RNA polymerase second largest subunit (rpb2), and translation elongation factor 1-alpha (tef1). A total of 62 strains representing 11 Neocosmospora species were isolated from crowns, trunks and roots of citrus trees affected by dry root rot, as well as from soils sampled in affected citrus orchards. The most commonly isolated taxa were N. citricola, N. ferruginea and N. solani, while rarely encountered taxa included N. brevis, N. crassa, N. hypothenemi and N. noneumartii. Furthermore, four Neocosmospora species are also newly described, namely N. addoensis, N. citricola, N. gamtoosensis and N. lerouxii.},

  abstract = {Mixed viral infections are common in plants, and the evolutionary dynamics of viral populations may differ depending on whether the infection is caused by single or multiple viral strains. However, comparative studies of single and mixed infections using viral populations in comparable agricultural and geographical locations are lacking. Here, we monitored the occurrence of pepino mosaic virus (PepMV) in tomato crops in two major tomato-producing areas in Murcia (southeastern Spain), supporting evidence showing that PepMV disease-affected plants had single infections of the Chilean 2 (CH2) strain in one area and the other area exhibited long-term (13 years) coexistence of the CH2 and European (EU) strains. We hypothesized that circulating strains of PepMV might be modulating the differentiation between them and shaping the evolutionary dynamics of PepMV populations. Our phylogenetic analysis of 106 CH2 isolates randomly selected from both areas showed a remarkable divergence between the CH2 isolates, with increased nucleotide variability in the geographical area where both strains cocirculate. Furthermore, the potential virus–virus interaction was studied further by constructing six full-length infectious CH2 clones from both areas, and assessing their viral fitness in the presence and absence of an EU-type isolate. All CH2 clones showed decreased fitness in mixed infections and although complete genome sequencing indicated a nucleotide divergence of those CH2 clones by area, the magnitude of the fitness response was irrespective of the CH2 origin. Overall, these results suggest that although agroecological cropping practices may be particularly important for explaining the evolutionary dynamics of PepMV in tomato crops, the cocirculation of both strains may have implications on the genetic variability of PepMV populations.},

However, information about viruses affecting the potato crop in South Korea is limited. In 2017, potato plants of five cultivars exhibiting foliar mosaic, crinkling, and mottle were collected in two seed potato production areas, in Gangwon-do and Jeollabuk-do Provinces, and subjected to virus testing and characterization. Potato virus Y (PVY) was found associated with mosaic symptoms, and samples were characterized using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and whole genome sequencing. All analyzed PVY-positive samples were found to represent the same recombinant PVY strain: PVY
              NTN
              . Three PVY isolates were subjected to whole genome sequencing using overlapping RT-PCR fragments and Sanger methodology, and all three were confirmed to represent strain PVY

C-source, temperature, and incubation period, and their interaction, affected the efficacy of the ASD treatment for the lettuce–R. solani pathosystem, with differences depending on the soil type. Brassica carinata pellets, used as a C-source, reduced incidence of Rhizoctonia basal rot in the first crop cycle by 50 to 69\% in a peat soil after 3 weeks of treatment at 21°C, and by 52 to 60\% after 3 weeks of treatment at 26 or 31°C, compared to the inoculated and untreated experimental controls without anaerobic conditions. The best disease reduction was provided by B. carinata pellets applied, under anaerobic conditions, to peat soil (79\% efficacy) and a sandy loam soil (100\% efficacy) kept at 31°C for 6 weeks. Generally, ASD based on B. carinata pellets provided greater disease reduction in the first crop cycle than the second, with the only exception being for results achieved in both soils incubated for 6 weeks at 21, 26 and 31°C. Wild rocket used as a C-source provided the greatest disease reduction (78–83\%) on plants grown in peat soil at the first crop cycle after 6 weeks of the ASD treatment at 31°C, while wild rocket provided disease reduction of 29 and 50\% when mixed with the sandy-loam soil under the same conditions for 6 weeks. The efficacy of the ASD treatment with compost was improved in the second crop cycle, compared to the first, resulting in the greatest disease reduction (52 and 66\% efficacy) reached in the sandy-loam soil incubated for 3 weeks at 21°C, and 63\% efficacy in peat soil previously treated for 6 weeks at 26 and 31°C. However, slight reductions in lettuce plant development was generally evident in the first crop cycle, which could be due to differences in efficacy of the tested ASD treatments and to phytotoxicity. The greatest yield from sandy loam soil was obtained for the B. carinata pellets and wild rocket at 26 and 31°C in the second cultivation cycle. Partial efficacy of ASD does not justify the adoption of this method against R. solani on lettuce under intensive crop systems. However, ASD based on Brassicaceae and compost as carbon source applied in a sandy-loam soil may be valuable for reducing R. solani incidence, at lower temperatures than those required for soil solarisation or biosolarisation.},

              Luteoviridae
              . Typical viral symptoms of PeVYV including interveinal yellowing of leaves and upward leaf curling were observed in pod pepper plants (
              Capsicum frutescens
              ) growing in Wenshan city, Yunnan province, China. The complete genome sequence of a virus from a sample of these plants was determined by next-generation sequencing and RT-PCR. Pod pepper vein yellows virus (PoPeVYV) (MT188667) has a genome of 6015 nucleotides, and the characteristic genome organization of a member of the genus
              Polerovirus
              . In the 5′ half of its genome (encoding P0 to P4), PoPeVYV is most similar (93.1\% nt identity) to PeVYV-3 (
              Pepper vein yellows virus 3
              ) (KP326573) but diverges greatly in the 3′-part encoding P5, where it is most similar (91.7\% nt identity) to tobacco vein distorting virus (TVDV, EF529624) suggesting a recombinant origin. Recombination analysis predicted a single recombination event affecting nucleotide positions 4126 to 5192 nt, with PeVYV-3 as the major parent but with the region 4126–5192 nt derived from TVDV as the minor parent. A full-length clone of PoPeVYV was constructed and shown to be infectious in
              C. frutescens
              by RT-PCR and the presence of icosahedral viral particles.},

  abstract = {A key feature of sedentary plant-parasitic nematodes is the release of effector proteins from their esophageal gland cells through their stylets into host roots. These proteinaceous stylet secretions have been shown to be crucial for successful parasitism by mediating the transition of normal root cells into specialized feeding sites and by negating plant defenses. Recent technical advances of purifying mRNA from esophageal gland cells of plant-parasitic nematodes coupled with emerging sequencing technologies is steadily expanding our knowledge of nematode effector repertoires. Host targets and biological activities of a number of nematode effectors are continuously being reported and, by now, a first picture of the complexity of sedentary nematode parasitism at the molecular level is starting to take shape. In this review, we highlight effector mechanisms that recently have been uncovered by studying the host–pathogen interaction. These mechanisms range from mediating susceptibility of host plants to the actual triggering of defense responses. In particular, we portray and discuss the mechanisms by which nematode effectors modify plant cell walls, negate host defense responses, alter auxin and polyamine signaling, mimic plant molecules, regulate stress signaling, and activate hypersensitive responses. Continuous molecular characterization of newly discovered nematode effectors will be needed to determine how these effectors orchestrate host signaling pathways and biological processes leading to successful parasitism.},

  abstract = {Elsinoë ampelina is an ascomycetous fungus that causes grape anthracnose, a potentially devastating disease worldwide. In this study, a dual RNA-seq analysis was used to simultaneously monitor the fungal genes related to pathogenesis and grape genes related to defense during the interaction at 2, 3, 4, and 5 days postinoculation. Consistent with their potential roles in pathogenicity, genes for carbohydrate-active enzymes, secondary metabolite synthesis, pathogen-host interaction, and those encoding secreted proteins are upregulated during infection. Based on Agrobacterium tumefaciens–mediated transient assays in Nicotiana benthamiana, we further showed that eight and nine candidate effectors, respectively, suppressed BAX- and INF1-mediated programmed cell death. The host response was characterized by the induction of multiple defense systems against E. ampelina, including synthesis of phenylpropanoids, stilbenes, and terpenoid biosynthesis, cell-wall modifications, regulation by phytohormones, and expression of defense-related genes. Together, these findings offer new insights into molecular mechanisms underlying the grape–E. ampelina interaction.

In 2008, two cultivars, ‘Q205’ and ‘Q170’, were highly susceptible in Bundaberg but remained disease free on a heavily infested farm in Mackay. A glasshouse experiment was established to determine whether the differences in disease expression were due to the sources of the two cultivars sourced from Bundaberg and Mackay in 2009. These were inoculated with the Mackay population of Sporisorium scitamineum spores. These cultivars had the same levels of disease, indicating that the variation in the clonal source of the cultivars was not responsible for the observed differences. A second glasshouse experiment in 2013 confirmed that highly susceptible Q205 and Q170 were resistant to the Mackay population of S. scitamineum but remained susceptible to the Bundaberg population. In 2010, S. scitamineum populations of smut fungi from Mackay and Bundaberg were compared in a field trial and the Mackay population had significantly less disease than the Bundaberg population on four cultivars (Q170, Q205, ‘Q174’, and ‘Q138’) but had significantly more disease in ‘Q188’. These results confirmed the field observations and suggested that there was a differential response among the cultivars for the smut fungi collected from Mackay compared with Bundaberg and are genetically different. This finding suggests that a mixture of spores should be used to inoculate sugarcane clones for resistance screening.},

  abstract = {Sugar beet root rot diseases that occur during the cropping season or in storage are accompanied by high yield losses and a severe reduction of processing quality. The vast diversity of microorganism species involved in rot development requires molecular tools allowing simultaneous identification of many different targets. Therefore, a new microarray technology (ArrayTube) was applied in this study to improve diagnosis of sugar beet root rot diseases. Based on three marker genes (internal transcribed spacer, translation elongation factor 1 alpha, and 16S ribosomal DNA), 42 well-performing probes enabled the identification of prevalent field pathogens (e.g., Aphanomyces cochlioides), storage pathogens (e.g., Botrytis cinerea), and ubiquitous spoilage fungi (e.g., Penicillium expansum). All probes were proven for specificity with pure cultures from 73 microorganism species as well as for in planta detection of their target species using inoculated sugar beet tissue. Microarray-based identification of root rot pathogens in diseased field beets was successfully confirmed by classical detection methods. The high discriminatory potential was proven by Fusarium species differentiation based on a single nucleotide polymorphism. The results demonstrate that the ArrayTube constitute an innovative tool allowing a rapid and reliable detection of plant pathogens particularly when multiple microorganism species are present.},

Multistage validation had been used in model creation by incorporating previously validated submodels for infection, latent period duration, sporulation, fungicide effects, and plant growth. Validation of the complete model was by comparison of model output with observed disease severities in 35 epidemics at nine location-years in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. We judge the model acceptable for its purposes, based on several tests. Graphs of modeled disease progress were generally congruent with plotted disease severity observations. There was negligible average bias in the 570 modeled-versus-observed comparisons across all data, although there was large variance in size of the deviances. Modeled severities were accurate in {\textgreater}80\% of the comparisons, where accuracy is defined as the modeled value being within twice the 95\% confidence interval of the observed value, within ± 1 day of the observation date. An interactive website was created to produce disease estimates by running STEMRUST\_G with user-supplied disease scouting information and automated daily weather data inputs from field sites. The model and decision aid supplement disease managers' information by estimating the level of latent (invisible) and expressed disease since the last scouting observation, given season-long weather conditions up to the present, and it estimates effects of fungicides on epidemic development. In additional large-plot experiments conducted in grower fields, the decision aid produced disease management outcomes (management cost and seed yield) as good as or better than the growers' standard practice. In future, STEMRUST\_G could be modified to create similar models and decision aids for stem rust of wheat and barley, after additional experiments to determine appropriate parameters for the disease in these small-grain hosts.},

However, removal of the colony center before signaling nearly doubled the latent period. A relationship between inoculum density and latent period was also observed, with latent period decreasing as the number of conidia deposited per square millimeter was increased. The effect was most pronounced at the lowest inoculum densities, with little decrease of the latent period as the density of inoculation increased above 10 spores/mm. Furthermore, light was shown to be necessary to initiate conidiation of sporulation-competent colonies. When plants were inoculated and maintained in a day-and-night cycle for 36 h but subjected to darkness after 36 h, colonies kept in darkness failed to sporulate for several days after plants kept in light had sporulated. Once returned to light, the dark-suppression was immediately reversed, and sporulation commenced within 12 h. Merging of colonies of compatible mating types resulted in near-cessation of sporulation, both in the region of merging and in more distant parts of the colonies. Colonies continued to expand but stopped producing new conidiophores once pairing of compatible mating types had occurred, and extant conidiophores stopped producing new conidia. Therefore, in addition to a quorum-sensing signal to initiate conidiation, there appears to be either signal repression or another signal that causes conidiation to cease once pairing has occurred and the pathogen has initiated the ascigerous stage for overwintering.},

Expression profiling of X. oryzae pv. oryzae LPS-treated rice (Oryza sativa subsp. indica) leaves showed that genes involved in the biosynthetic pathways for lignins, phenylpropanoids, chorismate, phenylalanine, salicylic acid, and ethylene, as well as a number of pathogenesis-related proteins are up-regulated. Gene ontology categories like cell-wall organization, defense response, stress response, and protein phosphorylation/kinases were found to be upregulated, while genes involved in photosynthesis were down-regulated. Coinfiltration with xanthan gum, the xanthomonas extracellular polysaccharide (EPS), suppressed LPS-induced callose deposition. Gene expression analysis of rice leaves that are treated with an EPS-deficient mutant of X. oryzae pv. oryzae indicated that a number of defense-regulated functions are up-regulated during infection. These transcriptional responses are attenuated in rice leaves treated with an EPS-deficient mutant that is also deficient in the O-antigen component of LPS. Overall, these results suggest that the O-antigen component of X. oryzae pv. oryzae LPS induces rice defense responses during infection and that these are suppressed by bacterial EPS.},

In all, 1,427 isolates of black-foot pathogens were collected from the asymptomatic inner tissues of surface sterilized secondary roots and characterized based on morphological features and DNA sequence data of the nuclear ribosomal DNA-internal transcribed spacer region, histone H3, translation elongation factor 1-alpha and β-tubulin genes. Eleven species belonging to the genera Dactylonectria, Ilyonectria, Neonectria, and Thelonectria were identified, including Dactylonectria alcacerensis, D. macrodidyma, D. novozelandica, D. pauciseptata, D. torresensis, Ilyonectria liriodendri, I. pseudodestructans, I. robusta, Neonectria quercicola, Neonectria sp. 1, and Thelonectria olida. In addition, two species are newly described, namely D. riojana and I. vivaria. Twenty-four isolates representing 13 black-foot species were inoculated onto grapevine seedlings cultivar ‘Tempranillo’. The pathogenicity tests detected diversity in virulence among fungal species and between isolates within each species. The most virulent species was D. novozelandica isolate BV-0760, followed by D. alcacerensis isolate BV-1240 and I. vivaria sp. nov. isolate BV-2305. This study improves our knowledge on the etiology and virulence of black-foot disease pathogens, and opens up new perspectives in the study of the endophytic phase of these pathogens in grapevines.},

Replanting can be necessary when flooding, poor seed germination, or cool soil temperatures result in poor plant establishment, which may be compounded by increased disease pressure. To identify which soilborne pathogens are associated with root rot disease complex on dry bean and to determine their prevalence, a survey was conducted from 2014 to 2018. Dry beans with root rot symptoms were obtained from 39 field locations in 10 counties in Michigan. Rotted roots were washed, potential pathogens were cultured, and isolates were putatively identified into the major pathogen groups based on morphology. Additional identification was conducted with sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer of rDNA for oomycetes and Rhizoctonia and the translation elongation factor 1-α gene for Fusarium isolates. Among the 1,034 isolates obtained, Fusarium (54\%) was recovered at the highest prevalence, and oomycetes and Rhizoctonia exhibited a consistent presence, ranging across years from 11 to 30.2\% and from 9.3 to 41.8\%, respectively. This survey provided baseline information on the prevalence of critical soilborne pathogens of dry bean in Michigan. In the future, additional genetic markers will be utilized to further identify organisms, a species characterization will be conducted to assess pathogenicity and virulence, and dry bean germplasm will be screened for resistance.},

The objective of this study was to monitor and compare the recent fungicide resistance profiles of Stagonosporopsis spp. in Florida open-field and East China protected-structure production systems. Isolates of Stagonosporopsis spp. were evaluated for sensitivity to the commonly used fungicides azoxystrobin, boscalid, tebuconazole, and thiophanate-methyl at discriminatory rates of 0.096, 0.034, 0.128, and 100 mg/liter, respectively. Isolates were collected from Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces in China (n = 69), 12 counties in Florida (n = 89), and one county in Georgia (n = 6). More than 50\% of isolates from Florida and East China were resistant to thiophanate-methyl. Boscalid resistance was detected in both isolate collections but was two times more frequent in China. Resistance to azoxystrobin was detected in 66\% of isolates in Florida but only 7\% in China. Tebuconazole was effective in controlling the mycelia growth of Stagonosporopsis spp. in both collections. The results indicate that both production systems currently face similar challenges related to the development of fungicide resistance in Stagonosporopsis spp. However, the resistance profiles are unique for both production systems.},

Well-known postharvest citrus fruit pathogens are Penicillium digitatum and P. italicum. Lesser-known pathogens include P. crustosum and P. expansum. This study examined pathogenicity and aggressiveness of Penicillium spp. present in fresh fruit supply chains on various Citrus spp. and cultivars. The impact of different inoculation methods and storage conditions on decay were also assessed. P. digitatum and P. italicum were the most aggressive Penicillium spp. on citrus but aggressiveness varied significantly over the evaluated citrus range. Decay and tissue-response lesions caused by P. crustosum were observed on ‘Nules Clementine’, ‘Nova’, ‘Owari Satsuma’, ‘Delta Valencia’, ‘Cambria Navel’, ‘Eureka’ seeded, and ‘Star Ruby’ for the first time. Likewise, these lesions caused by P. expansum were noted on Nules Clementine, Owari Satsuma, Delta Valencia, ‘Midknight Valencia’, and Eureka seeded for the first time. Tissue-response lesions affect fruit quality and some Penicillium spp. sporulated from the lesions, causing the inoculated species to complete their life cycle. New citrus–Penicillium spp. interactions were observed and the importance of monitoring inoculum loads of pathogens and nonhost pathogens were highlighted.},

  abstract   = {The ToxA–Tsn1 system is an example of an inverse gene-for-gene relationship. The gene ToxA encodes a host-selective toxin (HST) which functions as a necrotrophic effector and is often responsible for the virulence of the pathogen. The genomes of several fungal pathogens (e.g., Pyrenophora tritici-repentis, Parastagonospora nodorum, and Bipolaris sorokiniana) have been shown to carry the ToxA gene. Tsn1 is a sensitivity gene in the host, whose presence generally helps a ToxA-positive pathogen to cause spot blotch in wheat. Cultivars lacking Tsn1 are generally resistant to spot blotch; this resistance is attributed to a number of other known genes which impart resistance in the absence of Tsn1. In the present study, 110 isolates of B. sorokiniana strains, collected from the ME

              C megaenvironments of India, were screened for the presence of the ToxA gene; 77 (70\%) were found to be ToxA positive. Similarly, 220 Indian wheat cultivars were screened for the presence of the Tsn1 gene; 81 (36.8\%) were found to be Tsn1 positive. When 20 wheat cultivars (11 with Tsn1 and 9 with tsn1) were inoculated with ToxA-positive isolates, seedlings of only those carrying the Tsn1 allele (not tsn1) developed necrotic spots surrounded by a chlorotic halo. No such distinction between Tsn1 and tsn1 carriers was observed when adult plants were inoculated. This study suggests that the absence of Tsn1 facilitated resistance against spot blotch of wheat. Therefore, the selection of wheat genotypes for the absence of the Tsn1 allele can improve resistance to spot blotch.},

  abstract = {Spiroplasma citri is a phloem-limited bacterium causing citrus stubborn disease (CSD). Isolation and culturing of S. citri is technically demanding and time consuming. S. citri is typically low in titer and unevenly distributed in citrus, making reliable detection challenging. The current preferred detection method is polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays with primers developed from sequences of S. citri housekeeping genes. Recent genome sequencing of S. citri revealed that the bacterium harbors multiple copies of prophage genes. Therefore, targeting multicopy prophage genes was hypothesized to improve sensitivity of PCR detection. Two primer sets, Php-orf1 and Php-orf3, were developed from conserved prophage sequences in the S. citri genome. These primer sets were used to evaluate detection sensitivity in SYBR Green-based quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays with 18 S. citri in cultures isolated from different hosts and locations. Prophage primer set Php-orf1 increased detection sensitivity by 4.91 and 3.65 cycle threshold (Cq) units compared with housekeeping gene primers for spiralin and P58 putative adhesin gene, respectively. Detection was slightly less sensitive for the Php-orf3 primer set at 3.02 and 1.76 Cq units, respectively, over the same housekeeping gene primers. The prophage primer sets were validated for qPCR detection with field samples from three citrus orchards in California's San Joaquin Valley collected from 2007 to 2013. The data showed that S. citri prophage sequences improved sensitivity for qPCR detection of S. citri-infected trees at least 10-fold and reduced the number of false-negative results. No false-positive samples were detected with any of the primer sets. The enhanced sensitivity resulted from the higher copy number of prophage genes in the S. citri genome and, thus, improved CSD diagnosis from field samples.},

  abstract = {Anthracnose crown rot is an important disease of strawberry primarily caused by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides in Florida and North Carolina. Information on the magnitude of additive and nonadditive genetic variation is required to define breeding strategies and to estimate potential genetic gains. However, little is known about the genetic control of resistance and its utility in breeding. Our objectives were to obtain estimates of heritabilities and of components of genetic variances, genotype–environment interactions, and gains for resistance, and to examine the effects of locations and transplant types on the estimates. An incomplete diallel mating design generated 42 full-sib families, which were propagated in plugs from seed (seedling tests) and as bare-root runner plants (clonal tests) of different genotypes of the same families. Both seedlings and clones were inoculated with C. gloeosporioides under field conditions in North Carolina and Florida during the 2010–11 season. Narrow-sense heritability (h
              2
              ) and broad-sense heritability (H
              2
              ) for both clones and seedlings were higher at the North Carolina location (h
              2
              = 0.34 to 0.62 and H
              2

              = 0.16 to 0.22 and H
              2
              = 0.37 to 0.46). Likewise, the seedling tests showed higher genetic control than the clonal tests at both locations. Estimates of dominance variance were approximately one-third of the additive variance at North Carolina and were even larger at Florida. Epistasis was negative at both locations and assumed zero for heritability (H
              2
              ) calculations. Genotype–environment interactions were different by transplant type, suggesting rank changes across locations. ‘Pelican’ was the most resistant parent at both locations, followed by ‘NCH09-68’ at the NC location and ‘Winter Dawn’ at the Florida location. Selection and deployment of the most resistant clone within each of the five best families is estimated to produce average genetic gains of 53.0 and 73.7\% at the North Carolina and Florida locations, respectively.},

The pathogen was detected in vegetation surrounding the nursery production area, including the lawn, under the production benches during the growing season, and, most importantly, from plant debris in used trays. However, it was not found in the container substrate, water supplies, or production equipment or on the workers themselves. The sterilization methods used by the nursery were shown to be ineffective, indicating that a more rigorous method was required. Boiling trays for 15 min or steaming at 65°C for 60 min eradicated P. boodjera. This pathogen was more pathogenic to the eucalypts tested in their early seedling stage than P. cinnamomi. Tracing of out-planting to revegetation sites showed that P. boodjera was able to spread into the environment. Dispersal via out-planting to native vegetation may affect seedling recruitment and drive long-term shifts in native plant species. Inadequate nursery hygiene increases the risk of an outbreak and can limit the success of biosecurity efforts as well as damage conservation efforts.
          , 
            Interpretive summary
            Phytophthora spp. have the potential to infect horticultural, forestry, and native plants. The most effective and economical way to control the spread of these pathogens is good hygiene practice in the nursery. Once introduced, eradication of Phytophthora spp. is extremely difficult and costly. A forensic investigation of a eucalypt production nursery to find the cause of disease uncovered a newly described species, Phytophthora boodjera. All aspects of the nursery production cycle were tested to determine the source of contamination, including water and container substrate, production equipment, reused cleaned seedling trays, and the surrounding landscape. The pathogen was detected in vegetation surrounding the nursery production area, under the production benches during the production season, and in reused trays. P. boodjera was shown to be more pathogenic to the eucalypts tested in their early seedling stage than P. cinnamomi, a pathogen recognized as a key threat to Australian biodiversity. P. boodjera survived out-planting to revegetation sites. More research into this pathogen is required to determine how to best protect against it. The work highlights the importance of the nursery industry using effective sterilization techniques to prevent the unintentional spread of pathogens into natural ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Receptor-like proteins (RLPs) and receptor-like kinases (RLKs) are cell-surface receptors that are essential for detecting invading pathogens and subsequent activation of plant defense responses. RLPs lack a cytoplasmic kinase domain to trigger downstream signaling leading to host resistance. The RLK SOBIR1 constitutively interacts with the tomato RLP Cf-4, thereby providing Cf-4 with a kinase domain. SOBIR1 is required for Cf-4–mediated resistance to strains of the fungal tomato pathogen Cladosporium fulvum that secrete the effector Avr4. Upon perception of this effector by the Cf-4/SOBIR1 complex, the central regulatory RLK SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR KINASE 3a (SERK3a) is recruited to the complex and defense signaling is triggered. SOBIR1 is also required for RLP-mediated resistance to bacterial, fungal ,and oomycete pathogens, and we hypothesized that SOBIR1 is targeted by effectors of such pathogens to suppress host defense responses. In this study, we show that Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 effector AvrPto interacts with Arabidopsis SOBIR1 and its orthologs of tomato and Nicotiana benthamiana, independent of SOBIR1 kinase activity. Interestingly, AvrPto suppresses Arabidopsis SOBIR1-induced cell death in N. benthamiana. Furthermore, AvrPto compromises Avr4-triggered cell death in Cf-4-transgenic N. benthamiana, without affecting Cf-4/SOBIR1/SERK3a complex formation. Our study shows that the RLP coreceptor SOBIR1 is targeted by a bacterial effector, which results in compromised defense responses.},

In 2015, corn seedlings with discolored roots were arbitrarily sampled from 50 South Dakota fields, and 198 isolates were recovered. Eight species (F. acuminatum, F. boothii, F. equiseti-incarnatum complex, F. graminearum, F. oxysporum, F. proliferatum, F. solani, and F. subglutinans) were identified by morphology and translation elongation factor 1-α gene sequencing. F. graminearum (26.8\%) was the most common fungus, and F. boothii (0.5\%) was the least recovered. Fourteen isolates, representing the eight species, were evaluated for their pathogenicity on 2-week-old seedlings of inbred ‘B73’ using the inoculum layer method in the greenhouse. Fourteen days postinoculation, root rot severity was evaluated on a 1-to-5 rating scale and expressed as relative treatment effects (RTEs). F. proliferatum isolate P2 caused significantly greater RTE (based on 95\% confidence intervals) on seedlings than the other isolates and the noninoculated control, except F. graminearum isolate FG23. This study indicates that the eight species of Fusarium are aggressive root rot pathogens of corn in South Dakota, and this information will help evaluate strategies for producers to manage these pathogens in their fields.},

  abstract = {Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is the primary vegetable crop consumed worldwide and is largely affected by bacterial pathogens that can cause soft rot and blackleg disease. Recently, resistance to these diseases has been identified in the wild potato S. chacoense, and the mechanism of resistance is unknown. Here, it was hypothesized that S. chacoense stems or tubers have unique chemistry that confers resistance to the pathogen Pectobacterium brasiliense through bactericidal, bacteriostatic, or antivirulence activity. Stem and tuber metabolite extracts were collected from S. chacoense and tested for effects on Pectobacterium bacterial multiplication rates, and activity and expression of known exoenzymes and virulence genes using S. tuberosum extracts as a comparative control. Comparatively, the S. chacoense extracts did not affect bacterial multiplication rate; however, they did reduce pectinase, cellulase, and protease activities. The chemical extracts were profiled using a bioassay-guided fractionation, and a nontargeted metabolomics comparison of S. chacoense and S. tuberosum stems and tubers was performed. The data showed that selected alkaloids, phenolic amines, phenols, amines, and peptides are integrative chemical sources of resistance against the bacteria.

By transcriptional analysis, we were able to identify the gene core set specifically modulated in silks of maize plants expressing ISR. Our results showed that the main transcriptional reprogramming falls into genes involved in five main functional categories: cell structure or cell wall, amino acid and protein metabolism, stress responses, signaling, and transport. Among these ISR-related genes, it is important to highlight novel findings regarding hormone metabolism and signaling. The expression of hormone-dependent genes was in good agreement with the abscisic acid, jasmonic acid, and salicylic acid (SA) levels detected in the plants under study. The experimental design allowed the identification of novel regulatory elements related to a heightened state of defense in silks and suggests that steroids and SA are central components of a master regulatory network controlling the immunity of silks during ISR. The results presented also provide evidence about the molecular mechanisms used by maize silks against F. verticillioides to counteract pathogenic development and host invasion, including pathogenesis-related genes, plant cell-wall reinforcement, fungal cell-wall-degrading enzymes and secondary metabolism.},

  abstract = {Necrotrophic effectors (also known as host-selective toxins) are important determinants of disease in the wheat–Stagonospora nodorum pathosystem. To date, five necrotrophic effector–host gene interactions have been identified in this system. Most of these interactions have additive effects while some are epistatic. The Snn4–SnTox4 interaction was originally identified in a recombinant-inbred population derived from a cross between the Swiss winter wheat cultivars ‘Arina’ and ‘Forno’ using the S. nodorum isolate Sn99CH 1A7a. Here, we used a recombinant-inbred population consisting of 121 lines developed from a cross between the hexaploid land race Salamouni and the hexaploid wheat ‘Katepwa’ (SK population). The SK population was used for the construction of linkage maps and quantitative trait loci (QTL) detection using the Swiss S. nodorum isolate Sn99CH 1A7a. The linkage maps developed in the SK population spanned 3,228 centimorgans (cM) and consisted of 441 simple-sequence repeats, 9 restriction fragment length polymorphisms, 29 expressed sequence tag sequence-tagged site markers, and 5 phenotypic markers. The average marker density was 6.7 cM/marker. Two QTL, designated QSnb.fcu-1A and QSnb.fcu-7A on chromosome arms 1AS and 7AS, respectively, were associated with disease caused by the S. nodorum isolate Sn99CH 1A7a. The effects of QSnb.fcu-1A were determined by the Snn4–SnTox4 interaction and accounted for 23.5\% of the phenotypic variation in this population, whereas QSnb.fcu-7A accounted for 16.4\% of the phenotypic variation for disease but was not associated with any known effector sensitivity locus. The effects of both QTL were largely additive and collectively accounted for 35.7\% of the total phenotypic variation. The results of this research validate the effects of a compatible Snn4–SnTox4 interaction in a different genetic background, and it provides knowledge regarding genomic regions and molecular markers that can be used to improve Stagonospora nodorum blotch resistance in wheat germplasm.},

Research trials in Arizona have shown that some fungicides, such as boscalid and iprodione, can reduce disease incidence up to 50 to 60\%. Prior research also demonstrated that viability of S. minor and S. sclerotiorum sclerotia was completely arrested after subjection to a respective 2- and 3-week period of continuous flooding in soil during the summer. Widespread adoption of this cultural disease management tool led to concerns in southwestern Arizona about misuse of a precious resource in an arid environment, damage to drainage canals from excessive ground water, and rising water tables adversely affecting lettuce growth. Overall data from current studies, which compared reduction of sclerotia viability after continuous flooding to less intensive flooding of one 8-h period for 1 to 3 weeks or two 8-h periods for 3 weeks, revealed that continuous flooding was not better than 8-h flooding periods for sclerotia of S. minor but was superior for sclerotia of S. sclerotiorum. Because Arizona lettuce growers have to contend with both species of Sclerotinia, continuous flooding is still the best flooding alternative to achieve virtual elimination of viable sclerotia of both pathogens.},

Phytophthora ramorum was never detected on any of the sentinel plants (Rhododendron, Viburnum, and Loropetalum spp), indicating very limited aerial spread under suboptimal meteorological and environmental conditions. An infection experiment with host plants placed in the immediate vicinity of symptomatic plants proved the potential for short-distance (1 to 2 m) aerial transmission of P. ramorum. Other Phytophthora spp. causing symptoms similar to P. ramorum were detected during the rainy season (January to May) on the sentinel plants, among them potentially two novel species. These data reveal how sentinel monitoring at NORS-DUC allows for seasonal assessments of disease incidence and provide longitudinal data to assess the threat of P. ramorum movement in nurseries.},

              Background
              Circularization of RNA mediated by association of translation factors and RNA elements in 5′ and 3′ UTRs is a common feature for translation control in eukaryotes. There is no information about translation in plant rhabdoviruses and little information is known in animal rhabdoviruses.
            
            
              Methods
              The role of 5′ and 3′ UTRs in two genes of EMDV in translation were studied using luciferase constructs and RNA structures of these sequences were analyzed by SHAPE and Inline probing.
            
            
              Results
              
                We have found that efficient translation of N and X mRNAs of nucleorhabdovirus Eggplant mottled dwarf virus (EMDV) requires elements present in both 5′ and 3′ UTRs. Luciferase reporter constructs containing precise 5′ and 3′ UTRs of the N and X genes had substantially higher translational activity compared with constructs containing only the 5′ or 3′ UTR. The 3′UTR of
                carmovirus
                Turnip crinkle virus, which contains a well-characterized cap-independent translation enhancer, was unable to complement the lack of EMDV 3′ UTR. Addition of cap analog to luciferase constructs containing the UTRs of the N gene did not restore translation, and translation of the reporter construct in the absence of the 5′ cap was higher than the capped construct. No RNA-RNA interactions between 5′ and 3′ UTRs were detected by EMSA or in-line cleavage structural assays. Deletion of 11 nucleotides from the 3′ terminus negated the synergistic activity of the 3′UTR.
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              The results with RNA-RNA interaction suggesting that translational synergy between the UTRs may utilize alternative means. Mutation analysis in 3′UTR suggesting that the polyadenylation signal sequence contained in this location may play a critical role in translation.},

En tierras altas de México, la variabilidad genética de {\textless}em{\textgreater}P. infestans{\textless}/em{\textgreater}, bajas temperaturas, alta humedad relativa y luz favorecen su expresión e influyen en la eficacia de la infección. Este trabajo analizó el progreso de infección de {\textless}em{\textgreater}P. infestans{\textless}/em{\textgreater} respecto a lo esperado, observado y simulado durante dos ciclos de campo en Chapingo, México, con el objetivo de documentar y cuantificar el progreso de la infección foliar por {\textless}em{\textgreater}P. infestans{\textless}/em{\textgreater} en diferentes líneas de jitomate con diferentes niveles de resistencia. Así como validar un modelo predictivo. Con el registro de 10 años de datos meteorológicos, se predijeron cinco situaciones con cuatro a diez ciclos de infección de 8 a 13 h cada uno. En comparación con las predicciones, el efecto observado de área bajo la curva de progreso de la enfermedad (AUDPC) y sus componentes (RAUDPC y RaRAUDPC) fueron significativos, con bajo coeficiente de variación. Se concluye que entre los escenarios esperados, observados y simulados existe una estrecha relación para predecir epidemias de {\textless}em{\textgreater}P. infestans{\textless}/em{\textgreater}. Esto confirma que LATEBLIGHT es útil para simular y predecir la epidemia de tizón tardío, en condiciones atmosféricas de Chapingo.},

              Characterising the non-neutral genetic variation within and among populations of plant-parasitic nematodes is essential to determine factors shaping the population genetic structure. This study describes the genetic variation of the parasitism gene
              vap1
              within and among geographic populations of the beet cyst nematode
              Heterodera schachtii
              . Forty populations of
              H. schachtii
              were sampled at four spatial scales: 695 km, 49 km, 3.1 km and 0.24 km. DGGE fingerprinting showed significant differences in
              vap1
              patterns among populations. High similarity of
              vap1
              patterns appeared between geographically close populations, and occasionally among distant populations. Analysis of spatially sampled populations within fields revealed an effect of tillage direction on the
              vap1
              similarity for two of four studied fields. Overall, geographic distance and similarity of
              vap1
              patterns of
              H. schachtii
              populations were negatively correlated. In conclusion, the population genetic structure was shaped by the interplay between the genetic adaptation and the passive transport of this nematode.},

Phylogenetic, and nucleotide and amino acid sequence identity analyses of partial RNA2 and RNA3 of the two isolates showed that they were very similar to other CMV isolates from Mediterranean, European, and East Asian countries. Phylogenetic analysis of the partial sequence of RNA3 also showed that the onion isolates belong to subgroup IA. Onion isolates were mechanically transmissible, and caused mild leaf malformation on onion, severe leaf malformation and stunting on garlic (Allium sativus L.), and mosaic and mottle on cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) and melon (Cucumis melo L.).},

Here, genome sequencing of C. shiraiana based on PacBio RSII and Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform as well as manual gap filling was performed. Synteny analysis with Sclerotinia sclerotiorum revealed 16 putative chromosomes corresponding to 16 chromosomes of C. shiraiana. Screening of rapid-evolution genes revealed that 97 and 2.4\% of genes had undergone purifying selection and positive selection, respectively. When compared with S. sclerotiorum, fewer secreted effector proteins were found in C. shiraiana. The number of genes involved in pathogenicity, including secondary metabolites, carbohydrate active enzymes, and P450s, in the C. shiraiana genome was comparable with that of other necrotrophs but higher than that of biotrophs and saprotrophs. The growth-related genes and plant cell-wall-degradation-related genes in C. shiraiana were expressed in different developmental and infection stages, and may be potential targets for prevention and control of this pathogen. These results provide new insights into C. shiraiana pathogenic mechanisms, especially host range and necrotrophy features, and lay the foundation for further study of the underlying molecular mechanisms.

In March of 2018 and 2019, symptoms typical of blast were frequently observed on durum wheat plants under field conditions in Jashore, Bangladesh. The putative causal pathogen was isolated from infected wheat spike specimens onto potato dextrose agar and oatmeal agar, and was identified from mono-conidium cultures as Magnaporthe oryzae, based on morphological features. The pathotype of the fungus was identified as Triticum, based on comparative molecular analyses of ITS sequences and MoT3 specific markers. BLAST analysis revealed {\textgreater}99.8\% similarity with M. oryzae/P. oryzae, retrieved from the NCBI Genebank. This was confirmed through amplification of the predicted products with MoT3 primers in PCR analysis. Pathogenicity was confirmed by inoculating healthy durum wheat seedling leaves and spikes with a conidium suspensions of M. oryzae isolate DuBWMRI1901.2A. The fungus produced similar symptoms on inoculated leaves and spikes as those observed in the field, and was subsequently re-isolated, fulfilling Koch’s postulates.

              Background
              
                Rice stripe mosaic virus (RSMV) is a tentative new
                Cytorhabdovirus
                species in family
                Rhabdoviridae
                transmitted by the leafhopper
                Recilia dorsalis
                . Although the virus was first detected in southern China in 2015, few studies have investigated rice symptoms and yield losses caused by RSMV infection.
              
            
            
              Methods
              
                In this study, we observed and systematically compared symptoms of three virally infected, representative varieties of
                indica
                , hybrid and
                japonica
                rice and determined the yield parameters of the artificially inoculated plants.
              
            
            
              Results
              
                The three RSMV-infected cultivated rice varieties exhibited slight dwarfing, striped mosaicism, stiff, crinkled or even twisted leaves, an increased number of tillers, delayed heading, cluster-shaped shortening of panicles and mostly unfilled grains. Slight differences in symptom occurrence time were observed under different environmental conditions. For example, mosaic symptoms appeared earlier and crinkling symptoms appeared later, with both symptoms later receding in some infected plants. Yield losses due to RSMV also differed among varieties. The most serious yield reduction was experienced by
                indica
                rice (cv. Meixiangzhan), followed by hybrid
                indica
                rice (cv. Wuyou 1179) and then
                japonica
                (cv. Nipponbare). Single panicle weight, seed setting rate and 1000-kernel weight were reduced in the three infected varieties compared with healthy plants—by 85.42, 94.85 and 31.56\% in Meixiangzhan; 52.43, 53.06 and 25.65\% in Wuyou 1179 and 25.53, 49.32 and 23.86\% in Nipponbare, respectively.
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              Our findings contribute basic data for field investigations, formulation of prevention and control strategies and further study of the pathogenesis of RSMV.},

              Background
              
                In
                Raphanus sativus
                (Japanese radish), strain D8 of cucumber mosaic virus (CMV-D8) establishes a systemic infection and induces mild mosaic on upper, non-inoculated leaves, whereas strain Y of CMV (CMV-Y) causes only a local infection in the inoculated leaves. Here, we further analyzed the specific viral factor(s) of CMV-D8 that is (are) indispensable for systemic infection in Japanese radish.
              
            
            
              Methods
              To identify which genomic RNA(s) is (are) involved in systemic infection in radish, we carried out a pseudorecombination analysis between CMV-D8 and CMV-Y. With recombination analyses between CMV-D8 and CMV-Y using mutant/recombinant RNA2s, chimeric and point-mutated RNA3s, we identified viral factors that are indispensable for systemic infection.
            
            
              Results
              
                Viral RNA2 and RNA3 of CMV-D8 facilitated efficient virus spread into the upper, non-inoculated plant tissues of radish (cv. Tokinashi), but not those of CMV-Y. Recombinant RNA2s demonstrated that the 2b protein (2b) and the C-terminus of the 2a protein (2a) of CMV-D8 have a crucial role in systemic infection. In addition, we used chimeric and point-mutated RNA3s to that Pro

                and Pro

                in the 3a protein (3a) of CMV-D8 has positive effects on systemic spread. The results suggested that these viral factors facilitate systemic infection of CMV-D8 in Japanese radish.
              
            
            
              Conclusion

Functional data analysis, on the other hand, reconstructs the assumed continuous process (represented by a series of recorded weather data) by using smoothing functions, and is an alternative way of working with time series data with respect to FHB risk. Our objective was to functionally model weather-based time series data linked to 865 observations of FHB (covering 16 states and 31 years in total), classified as epidemics (FHB disease index ≥ 10\%) and nonepidemics (FHB disease index {\textless} 10\%). Altogether, 94 different time series variables were modeled by penalized cubic B-splines for the smoothing function, from 120 days pre-anthesis to 20 days post-anthesis. Functional mean curves, standard deviations, and first derivatives were plotted for FHB epidemics relative to nonepidemics. Function-on-scalar regressions assessed the temporal trends of the magnitude and significance of the mean difference between functionally represented weather time series associated with FHB epidemics and nonepidemics. The mean functional weather-variable curve for epidemics started to deviate, in general, from that for nonepidemics as early as 40 days pre-anthesis for several weather variables. The greatest deviations were often near anthesis, the period of maximum susceptibility of wheat to FHB-causing fungi. The most consistent separations between the mean functional curves were seen with the daily averages of moisture-related variables (such as average relative humidity) and with variables summarizing the daily variation in temperature (as opposed to the daily mean). Functional data analysis was useful for extending our knowledge of relationships between weather variables and FHB epidemics.},

Two-hundred Alternaria strains were collected from four different pedo-climatic areas in Tunisia, from C. maritima fresh plant tissues showing symptoms of Alternaria infection. Phylogenetic analyses of 79 representative Alternaria strains, were carried out using multi-locus gene sequencing. All the strains clustered in the Alternaria Section: 47 strains had high homology with A. alternata reference strain, 13 grouped with A. arborescens reference strain, 12 grouped with A. mali reference strain, and seven strains were not well defined with A. mali as their closest species. In vitro production of tenuazonic acid (TA), alternariol (AOH), alternariol-monomethyl ether (AME), and altenuene (ALT) was evaluated. Approx. 68\% of strains simultaneously produced AOH, AME and TA. Only two A. alternata and one A. mali strains were ALT producing. Pathogenicity tests on leaves of C. maritima were carried out with 41 representative strains. Alternaria arborescens showed the greatest pathogenicity compared to A. alternata and A. mali, although no statistically significant differences in pathogenicity were observed. This is the first study on Tunisian populations of Alternaria species isolated from the extremophile C. maritima.},

During field survey in southern Italy, several plants of Phytolacca americana showing virus-like symptoms were collected. Serological and molecular assays showed that these plants were infected by PMoV. Sequence comparison of the movement protein gene of the PMoV isolate from P. americana showed the greatest similarity to the corresponding sequence from tomato plants growing nearby.

In this study, a collection of bacterial isolates associated with necrotic symptoms in mango trees similar to those produced by bacterial apical necrosis disease were isolated over five consecutive years in orchards from the Canary Islands. The bacterial isolates were characterized and identified as Pantoea agglomerans. Pathogenicity tests conducted on onion bulbs and mango plants confirmed that P. agglomerans strains isolated from mango trees are a new etiological agent of a bacterial necrotic disease in the Canary Islands. Pathogenicity plasmids of the pPATH family have been previously reported in P. agglomerans. The majority of putatively pathogenic (n = 23) and pathogenic (n = 4) P. agglomerans strains isolated from mango trees harbored four plasmids, one of which was close in size to the 135-kb pPATH pathogenicity plasmid. The analysis of the presence of two major genes in pPATH plasmids (repA and hrpJ) was undertaken in P. agglomerans strains isolated from mango trees. The hrpJ gene was detected in the 140-kb plasmid of pathogenic P. agglomerans strains isolated from mango trees but it showed differences in nucleotide sequences compared with other pathogenic strains. In contrast, the repA gene was not detected in any of the putatively pathogenic and pathogenic P. agglomerans strains isolated from mango trees. Finally, genetic characterization and phylogenetic analysis using the hrpJ gene and the housekeeping genes gyrB and rpoB showed that almost all P. agglomerans strains that were putatively pathogenic and pathogenic on mango trees clustered together, forming a differentiated phylogroup with respect to the other pathogenic P. agglomerans strains described from other hosts.},

  abstract = {Mango anthracnose, caused by Colletotrichum spp., is the most significant disease of mango (Mangifera indica L.) in almost all production areas around the world. In Mexico, mango anthracnose has only been attributed to C. asianum and C. gloeosporioides. The aims of this study were to identify the Colletotrichum species associated with mango anthracnose symptoms in Mexico by phylogenetic inference using the ApMat marker, to determine the distribution of these species, and to test their pathogenicity and virulence on mango fruits. Surveys were carried out from 2010 to 2012 in 59 commercial orchards in the major mango growing states of Mexico, and a total of 118 isolates were obtained from leaves, twigs, and fruits with typical anthracnose symptoms. All isolates were tentatively identified in the C. gloeosporioides species complex based on morphological and cultural characteristics. The Bayesian inference phylogenetic tree generated with Apn2/MAT intergenic spacer sequences of 59 isolates (one per orchard) revealed that C. alienum, C. asianum, C. fructicola, C. siamense, and C. tropicale were associated with symptoms of mango anthracnose. In this study, C. alienum, C. fructicola, C. siamense, and C. tropicale are reported for the first time in association with mango tissues in Mexico. This study represents the first report of C. alienum causing mango anthracnose worldwide. The distribution of Colletotrichum species varied among the mango growing states from Mexico. Chiapas was the only state in which all five species were found. Pathogenicity tests on mango fruit cultivar Manila showed that all Colletotrichum species from this study could induce anthracnose lesions. However, differences in virulence were evident among species. C. siamense and C. asianum were the most virulent, whereas C. alienum and C. fructicola were considered the least virulent species.},

At the earlier stages the johnsongrass cultivars showed hypersensitive responses and small lesions; however, acervulus formation was not observed. When late growth stage johnsongrass plants were spray inoculated, acervulus formation was confirmed in 19 cultivars as early as 5 days postinoculation.

              Background
              Citrus industry is worldwide dramatically affected by outbreaks of Citrus tristeza virus (CTV). Controls should be applied to nurseries, which could act as diversity hotspots for CTV. Early detection and characterization of dangerous or emerging strains of this virus greatly help to prevent outbreaks of disease. This is particularly relevant in those growing regions where no dedicated certification programs are currently in use.
            
            
              Methods
              Double-stranded RNA extracted from Citrus spp. samples, collected in two locations in Angola, were pooled and submitted to a random-primed RNA-seq. This technique was performed to acquire a higher amount of data in the survey, before the amplification and sequencing of genes from single plants. To confirm the CTV infection in individual plants, as suggested by RNA-seq information from the pooled samples, the analysis was integrated with multiple molecular marker amplification (MMM) for the main known CTV strains (T30, T36, VT and T3).
            
            
              Results
              From the analysis of HTS data, several assembled contigs were identified as CTV and classified according to their similarity to the established strains. By the MMM amplification, only five individual accessions out of the eleven pooled samples, resulted to be infected by CTV. Amplified coat protein genes from the five positive sources were cloned and sequenced and submitted to phylogenetic analysis, while a near-complete CTV genome was also reconstructed by the fusion of three overlapping contigs.
            
            
              Conclusion
              Phylogenetic analysis of the ORF1b and CP genes, retrieved by de novo assembly and RT-PCR, respectively, revealed the presence of a wide array of CTV strains in the surveyed citrus-growing spots in Angola. Importantly, molecular variants among those identified from HTS showed high similarity with known severe strains as well as to recently described and emerging strains in other citrus-growing regions, such as S1 (California) or New Clade (Uruguay).},

Recent investigations have shown that both C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum are species complexes. The identities of Colletotrichum species causing anthracnose disease of rubber tree in Hainan, China, are unknown. In this study, 106 isolates obtained from rubber tree with symptoms of anthracnose were collected from 12 counties of Hainan and identified at the species complex level based on the ITS sequences and colony morphologies. Seventy-four isolates were identified as C. gloeosporioides species complex and the other 32 isolates as C. acutatum species complex. Forty-two isolates were selected for further multilocus phylogenetic analyses in order to identify the isolates to the species level. Twenty-six isolates from the C. gloeosporioides species complex were characterized for partial sequences of seven gene regions (ACT, TUB2, CHS-1, GAPDH, ITS, ApMat, and GS), and the other 16 isolates from the C. acutatum species complex for five gene regions (ACT, TUB2, CHS-1, GAPDH, and ITS). Three species were identified: C. siamense and C. fructicola from the C. gloeosporioides species complex, and a new species C. wanningense from the C. acutatum species complex. Artificial inoculation of rubber tree leaves confirmed the pathogenicity of the three species. The present study improves the understanding of species causing anthracnose on rubber tree and provides useful information for the effective control of the disease.},

Current management recommendations are to spray broad-spectrum fungicides every year in regions such as New Jersey where fruit rot incidence is high on a consistent basis. By contrast, in regions such as Wisconsin, where economic losses from fruit rot occur sporadically, many growers forego fungicide sprays, but if faced with a serious fruit rot outbreak they then spray fungicides intensively the following year to prevent a recurrence of disease. This recommendation is based on the untested assumption that left unchecked, fruit rot incidence will increase and that the predominant fruit rot pathogens will persist from one year to the next. Field studies conducted over 3 years showed that in New Jersey fruit rot incidence increased or remained high and fruit rot pathogens persisted from one year to the next. By contrast, in Wisconsin fruit rot incidence decreased or remained low, and the persistence of pathogens was inconsistent from one year to the next. Thus, in Wisconsin, fruit rot incidence and fungal species present in one year do not reliably predict the disease situation in the following year, a finding that should be considered when planning fungicide spray programs.},

              The bacterial communities in the wound tissues of
              Pinus massoniana
              were analysed by 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing. The results showed that the bacterial richness and diversity changed remarkably whether the wound was inoculated with pine wood nematode (PWN;
              Bursaphelenchus xylophilus
              ) or not after 12 h. However, the predominant bacteria
              Stenotrophomonas

              Pseudomonas
              ,

              and
              Delftia
              , introduced by PWN in the wound tissues, changed within 6 h. After 6 h of PWN inoculation, the most abundant genus associating with PWN,
              Stenotrophomonas
              , failed to colonise the wound tissues, and the abundance of
              Delftia
              decreased, while the other representative bacteria, Burkholderiaceae,
              Pseudomonas
              and
              Serratia
              , from the PWN were markedly enriched. In addition, our study is the first to report the association of
              Serratia liquefaciens
              with PWN. Predicted functional analyses using the Tax4Fun tool showed that the alterations in bacterial composition also led to shifts in their functional pathways, especially after 12 h of PWN inoculation. These findings clarified that the bacteria carried by PWN were responsible for the alterations in bacterial communities in the wound tissues and will shed light on the invasion mechanism of PWN.},

Este trabajo se desarrolló en Jalisco, México, principal región DOT, para determinar la inductividad epidémica espacio-temporal del hongo y desarrollar modelos estocásticos de pronóstico de la mancha gris con el fin de sustentar acciones preventivas regionales. De octubre 2016 a diciembre 2017 se evaluó mensualmente la severidad, incidencia y número de plantas enfermas en 41 parcelas establecidas en plantaciones comerciales de agave de 3-4 años de edad seleccionadas con criterios ponderados de riesgo en Los Altos (20), Valles (11) y Sur (10). La inductividad epidémica regional de{\textless}em{\textgreater} C. agavicola{\textless}/em{\textgreater} fue heterogénea con mayor riesgo para al menos nueve municipios de Los Altos. Sin embargo, bajas tasas epidémicas (0.0008-0.006 unidades semana-1), fuerte restricción de contagio (1-4 plantas), reducido incremento anual de incidencia (0-32 plantas/0.5 ha) y nula captura de esporas evidenciaron la baja aptitud parasítica y epidémica del hongo. Consecuentemente, se encontró limitada capacidad predictiva aun con los mejores modelos generados (R2adj 0.51-0.60). Las horas favorables (HFav) de enero-abril, respecto a la infección, fue consistente entre modelos por lo que puede integrarse como algoritmo preventivo en SIVEA (www.sivea.org.mx). Las pérdidas regionales, bajo los parámetros epidémicos establecidos, se estimaron entre 98.01 MDD y 237 mil dólares americanos. La cercosporina, toxina asociada al género {\textless}em{\textgreater}Cercospora,{\textless}/em{\textgreater} puede estar implicada en el progreso temporal lineal atípico y debe integrarse en futuras investigaciones.},

We tested the effect of the fungus Clonostachys rosea strain IK726 inoculation on nematode community composition in a naturally nematode infested soil in a pot experiment, and the effect of C. rosea on plant health. The numbers of plant-parasitic nematode genera extracted from soil and plant roots decreased by 40 to 73\% when C. rosea was applied, while genera of nonparasitic nematodes were not affected. Soil inoculation of C. rosea increased fresh shoot weight and shoot length of wheat plants by 20 and 24\%, respectively, while only shoot dry weight increased by 48\% in carrots. Light microscopy of in vitro C. rosea–nematode interactions did not reveal evidence of direct parasitism. However, culture filtrates of C. rosea growing in potato dextrose broth, malt extract broth and synthetic nutrient broth exhibited toxicity toward nematodes and immobilized 57, 62, and 100\% of the nematodes, respectively, within 48 h. This study demonstrates that C. rosea can control plant-parasitic nematodes and thereby improve plant growth. The most likely mechanism responsible for the antagonism is antibiosis through production of nematicidal compounds, rather than direct parasitism.},

Automated analyses were used to compare a range of statistical methods for their ability to predict BBR epidemics, including the Kruskal-Wallis test, logistic regression, receiver operating characteristic analysis, and skill-scores. Variables based on relative humidity and surface-wetness duration were significant and consistent predictors of BBR epidemics across the range of analyses applied. Variables integrating temperature and wetness duration, including the Bacchus and Broome models, also demonstrated high predictive ability; however, they did not outperform their constituent components in all analyses. Automation of data analyses was an effective way to compare a wide range of statistical methods and a large number of variables with minimal user input, following initial code development. Significant time was needed to check input data and software code, but a greater return on investment would occur should the analytical process be applied to new datasets, including those from other pathosystems.},

              Background
              
                Cassava mosaic disease (CMD) is one of the most devastating viral diseases for cassava production in Africa and Asia. Accurate yet affordable diagnostics are one of the fundamental tools supporting successful CMD management, especially in developing countries. This study aimed to develop an antibody-based immunoassay for the detection of
                Sri Lankan cassava mosaic virus
                (SLCMV), the only cassava mosaic begomovirus currently causing CMD outbreaks in Southeast Asia (SEA).
              
            
            
              Methods
              Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against the recombinant coat protein of SLCMV were generated using hybridoma technology. MAbs were characterized and used to develop a triple antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (TAS-ELISA) for SLCMV detection in cassava leaves and stems. Assay specificity, sensitivity and efficiency for SLCMV detection was investigated and compared to those of a commercial ELISA test kit and PCR, the gold standard.
            
            
              Results
              
                A TAS-ELISA for SLCMV detection was successfully developed using the newly established MAb 29B3 and an in-house polyclonal antibody (PAb) against begomoviruses, PAb PK. The assay was able to detect SLCMV in leaves, green bark from cassava stem tips, and young leaf sprouts from stem cuttings of SLCMV-infected cassava plants without cross-reactivity to those derived from healthy cassava controls. Sensitivity comparison using serial dilutions of SLCMV-infected cassava sap extracts revealed that the assay was 256-fold more sensitive than a commercial TAS-ELISA kit and 64-fold less sensitive than PCR using previously published SLCMV-specific primers. In terms of DNA content, our assay demonstrated a limit of detection of 2.21 to 4.08 × 10
                6
                virus copies as determined by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). When applied to field samples (n = 490), the TAS-ELISA showed high accuracy (99.6\%), specificity (100\%), and sensitivity (98.2\%) relative to the results obtained by the reference PCR. SLCMV infecting chaya (
                Cnidoscolus aconitifolius
                ) and coral plant (
                Jatropha multifida
                ) was also reported for the first time in SEA.
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              Our findings suggest that the TAS-ELISA for SLCMV detection developed in this study can serve as an attractive tool for efficient, inexpensive and high-throughput detection of SLCMV and can be applied to CMD screening of cassava stem cuttings, large-scale surveillance, and screening for resistance.},

              n. sp., the third species of this apparently rare genus, is described and illustrated. It was recovered from wood and bark samples from a dead forest tree in the Golestan province of northern Iran. It is typologically characterised by female body length (448 (365-492) 
              μ
              m), three lines in the lateral fields, raised cephalic region having a sclerotised vestibule and cephalic framework, stylet thin with delicate conus and thicker shaft, both parts lacking a visible lumen, and with three elongate, backwardly directed knobs, small, spherical to spade-shaped metacorpus with small, posteriorly located valve (at 72 (58-74)\% of metacorpus length), simple vulva without flap at 72.5 (69-78)\% of body length, post-vulval uterine sac 32.4 (29.0-37.0) 
              μ
              m long, functional rectum and anus, female tail conical, short (c′ = 2.6 (1.9-3.3) in female, and 2.5 (2.3-2.8) in male), dorsally convex and ventrally concave with blunt end or having a small mucron, both forms with a hyaline-like tip. Males common, with well-curved 9.2 (9.0-10.5) 
              μ
              m long spicules measured along the mid-line, three pairs of small caudal papillae (lacking the single P1 ventral papilla) and no bursa at tail tip, but with hyaline region, similar to females.

  abstract = {Charcoal rot, caused by the fungus Macrophomina phaseolina, is an economically important disease of soybean (Glycine max) worldwide. Objectives of the present research were to (i) study the genetic and pathogenic diversity in a collection of M. phaseolina isolates from Argentina and Paraguay and (ii) develop an improved in vitro phenotyping method to evaluate disease response of soybean genotypes to M. phaseolina isolates. Cluster analysis showed no clear association among simple sequence repeat profiles, year of collection, pathogenicity, and geographical origin of the isolates from Argentina and Paraguay. Subsequently, the response of four soybean genotypes against seven M. phaseolina isolates was evaluated in the field and the results were confirmed using the in vitro assay developed. This assay, which is based on root disease development on soybean seedlings, allowed the detection of a differential level of aggressiveness among the isolates on four soybean genotypes. The results suggest the existence of specific interactions among soybean genotypes and M. phaseolina isolates. In addition, cultivar Munasqa RR showed a superior response against M. phaseolina compared with DT 97-4290 (moderately resistant), thus becoming a novel source of resistance to charcoal rot.},

              population indicates that some quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were controlling the FHB resistance in PI 672538. We further detected two major QTLs (Qfhs-2B, Qfhs-3B) from analysis of the resistance data and the PCR-amplified results using WinQTLCart 2.5 software. Qfhs-2B, flanked by Xbarc55-2B and Xbarc1155-2B, explained more than 11.6\% of the phenotypic variation of the percentage of diseased spikelets (PDS), and Qfhs-3B, flanked by Xwmc54-3B and Xgwm566-3B, explained more than 10\% of the PDS phenotypic variation in the F
              2:3
              population. In addition, Qfhs-3B was different from Fhb1 in terms of the pedigree, inheritance, resistance response, chromosomal location, and marker diagnosis. We also detected QTLs for other disease resistance indices, including the percentage of damaged kernels and 1,000-grain weight, in similar chromosomal regions. Therefore, the FHB resistance of PI 672538 was mainly controlled by two major QTLs, mapped on 2B (FhbL693a) and 3B (FhbL693b). PI 672538 could be a useful germplasm for improving wheat FHB resistance.},
